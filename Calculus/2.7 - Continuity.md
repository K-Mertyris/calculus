We'll now explore continuity, starting with **continuity at a point**. Intuitively, a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point; however, as often is the case, intuition has its flaws.

## Continuity at a Point
---

Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let's onsider various functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create a list of conditions that prevent such failures.

Our first function of interest is shown in the figure below. We see that the graph of $f(x)$ has a hole at point $a$. In fact, $f(a)$ is undefined. At the very least, for $f(x)$ to be continuous at $a$, we need the following condition: $f(a)$ is defined.

![[fig-2-7-1.png]]

This condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point $a$. Although $f(a)$ is defined, the function has a gap at $a$. In this example, the gap exists because $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ does not exist. We must add another condition for continuity at $a$ - namely: $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists.
![[fig-2-7-2.png]]

These two conditions do not guarantee continuity at a point. The function in the next figure satisfies both of our first two conditions, but is still not continuous at $a$. We must add a third condition to our list: $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$
![[fig-2-7-3.png]]

Now we put the conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.

>[!Note] Definition: Continuous at a Point
>
>A function $f(x)$ is said to be **continuous at point $a$** if each of the following three conditions are satisfied:
>1. $f(a)$ is defined
>2. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists
>3. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$
>
>A function is **discontinuous at point $a$** if it fails to be continuous at $a$

Some examples:

>[!Success] Examples of Determining Continuity at a Point
>
>1. Using the definition, determine whether the function $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}$ is continuous at $x=2$. Justify the conclusion
>	1. Calculate $f(2)$.
>		1. $f(2)=\frac{4-4}{2-2}$ which is undefined.

>2. Determine whether the function $f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2+4, & \quad \text{if } x\le 3\\ 4x-8, & \quad \text{if } x>3 \end{cases}$ is continuous at $x=3$. Justify the conclusion
>	1. Calculate $f(3)$
>		1. $f(3)=-(3)^2+4=-5$ -- $f(3)$ is defined
>	2. Calculate $\lim\limits_{x\to 3}f(x)$. To do this, we must compute the right- and left-hand limits
>		1. $\lim\limits_{x\to 3^-}f(x)=-(3^2)+4=-5$
>		2. $\lim\limits_{x\to 3^+}f(x)=4(3)-8=4$
>		3. Therefore $\lim\limits_{x\to 3}f(x)$ does not exist. $f(x)$ is not continuous at 3.
>3. Determine whether the function $f(x)=\begin{cases} \frac{\sin x}{x}, & \quad \text{if } x\not = 0\\ 1, & \quad \text{if } x=0 \end{cases}$ is continuous at $x=0$
>	1. Calculate $f(0)$
>		1. $f(0)=1$
>	2. Calculate $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{\sin x}{x}=1$
>	3. Compare $f(0)$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to0}f(x)$.
>		1. $f(0)=1=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f(x)$
>
>Since all three conditions in the definition of continuity are satisfied, $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$

By applying the definition of continuity and previously established theorems concerning the evaluation of limits, we can state the following theorem.

>[!Example] Theorem: Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions
>
>Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.
>
>**Proof**
>
>Previously, we showed that if $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials $\lim\limits_{x\to a}p(x)=p(a)$ for every polynomial $p(x)$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to a}\dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\dfrac{p(a)}{q(a)}$ as long as $q(a)\not=0$. Therefore, polynomials and rational functions are continuous on their domains.

We now apply this theorem to determine the points at which a given rational function is continuous.

>
>For what values of $x$ is $f(x)=\dfrac{x+1}{x-5}$ continuous?
>
>**Solution**
>The rational function $f(x)=\dfrac{x+1}{x-5}$ is continuous for every value of $x$ except $x=5$

## Types of Discontinuities
---

As we have seen in the above examples, discontinuities take on different appearances. The types of discontinuities we've seen so far are **removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, and jump discontinuities**.
- **Removable discontinuity**: a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph
- **Jump discontinuity**: a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up
- **Infinite discontinuity**: a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote

![[fig-2-7-6.png]]

Formal definitions below.

>[!Note] Definition: Types of Discontinuities
>
>If $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $a$, then
>1. $f$ has a **removable discontinuity** at $a$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists.
>	1. Note: when we state that $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists, we mean that $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L$, where $L$ is a real number
>2. $f$ has a **jump discontinuity** at $a$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)$ both exist, but $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)\not=\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)$
>	1. Note: when we state that $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x), \lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)$ both exist, we mean that both are real-valued and that neither take on the values $\pm\infty$.
>3. $f$ has an **infinite discontinuity** at $a$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\pm\infty$ or $\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\pm\infty$

## Continuity over an Interval
---

After exploring continuity at a point, we extend the idea to **continuity over an interval**. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin by looking at the definition of what it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and continuous from the left at a point.

>[!Note] Definition: Continuity from the Right and from the Left
>
>A function $f(x)$ is said to be **continuous from the right** at $a$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to a^+} f(x)=f(a)$
>
>A function $f(x)$ is said to be **continuous from the left** at $a$ if $\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)=f(a)$

Over intervals:

>[!Note] Definition: Continuity over Intervals
>
>A function is **continuous over an open interval** if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function $f(x)$ is **continuous over a closed interval** of the form $[a,b]$ if it is continuous at every point in $(a,b)$ and is continuous from the right at $a$ and is continuous from the left at $b$.
>
>A function $f(x)$ is continuous over an open interval of the form $(a,b]$ if it is continuous over $(a,b)$ and is continuous from the left at $b$. 
>
>Continuity over other types of intervals are defined in a similar fashion.

Requiring that $\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)=f(a)$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to b^-}f(x)=f(b)$ ensures that we can trace the graph of the function from the point $(a,f(a))$ to the point $(b,f(b))$ without lifting the pencil. If, for example $\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)\not=f(a)$, we would need to lift our pencil to jump from $f(a)$ to the graph of the rest of the function over $(a,b]$.

## Continuity and Compositions
---

>[!Example] Theorem: Composite Function Theorem
>
>If $f(x)$ is continous at $L$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x)=L$, then $$\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(g(x))=f(\lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x))=f(L)$$

The composite function theorem allows us to expand our ability to compute limits. In particular, this theorem ultimately allows us to demonstrate that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains.

In the section on Limit Laws, we showed $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\cos x=1=\cos(0)$. Consequently, we know that $f(x)=\cos x$ is continuous at 0. Below, we'll see how to combine this result with the Composite Function Theorem.

>[!Success] Example: Limit of a Composite Cosine Function
>
>Evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\to \pi/2}\cos \bigg(x-\dfrac{\pi}{2}\bigg)$
>
>**Solution**
>The given function is a composite of $\cos x$ and $x-\frac{\pi}{2}$. Since $\lim\limits_{x\to \pi/2}\bigg(x-\dfrac{\pi}{2}\bigg)=0$ and $\cos x$ is continous at 0, we may apply the Composite Function Theorem
>
>$\lim\limits_{x\to \pi/2}\cos\bigg(x-\dfrac{\pi}{2}\bigg) = \cos\bigg(\lim\limits_{x\to \pi/2}\bigg(x-\dfrac{\pi}{2}\bigg)\bigg)=\cos(0)=1$

The proof of the next theorem uses the Composite Function Theorem as well as the continuity of $f(x)=\sin(x)$ and $g(x)=\cos(x)$ at the point 0 to show that trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

>[!Example] Theorem: Continuity of Trigonometric Functions
>
>Trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains
>
>**Proof**
>
>We begin by demonstrating that $\cos(x)$ is continuous at every real number. To do this, we must show that $\lim\limits_{x\to a}\cos(x)=\cos(a)$ for all values of $a$.
>1. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}\cos x=\lim\limits_{x\to a}\cos((x-a)+a)$ 
>	1. Rewriting $x = x - a + a$
>2. $= \lim\limits_{x\to a}(\cos(x-a)\cos(a)-\sin(x-a)\sin(a))$
>	1. Apply the identity for the cosine of the sum of two angles
>3. $\cos(\lim\limits_{x\to a}(x-a))\cos(a)-\sin(\lim\limits_{x\to a}(x-a))\sin(a)$
>	1. Since $\lim\limits_{x\to a}(x-a)=0$ and $\sin(x), \cos(x)$ are continuous at 0
>4. $=\cos(0)\cos(a)-\sin(0)\sin(a)$
>	1. Evaluate $\cos(0)$ and $\sin(0)$ and simplify
>5. $=1\cdot\cos(a)-0 \cdot\sin(a)=\cos(a)$
>
>The proof that $\sin(x)$ is continuous at every real number is analogous. Because the remaining trigonometric functions may be expressed in terms of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$, their continuity follows from the quotient limit law.

The Composite Function Theorem is invaluable in demonstrating the continuity of trigonometric functions. We'll revisit this theorem many times.

## The Intermediate Value Theorem
---

Functions that are continuous over intervals of the form $[a,b]$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, exhibit many useful properties. We will encounter many powerful theorems concerning such functions. The first of these theorems is the **Intermediate Value Theorem**.

>[!Example] Theorem: Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
>
>Let $f$ be continuous over a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$. If $z$ is any real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there is a number $c$ in $[a,b]$ satisfying $f(c)=z$

![[fig-2-7-7.png]]

Some examples of the IVT in use.

>[!Success] Examples of the Intermediate Value Theorem
>
>1. Show that $f(x)=x-\cos(x)$ has at least one zero
>	1. Since $f(x)=x-\cos(x)$ is continuous over $(-\infty, +\infty)$, it is continuous over any closed interval of the form $[a,b]$. If we can find an interval $[a,b]$ such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, we can use the IVT to conclude there must be a rel number $c$ in $(a,b)$ that satisfies $f(c)=0$. Note that $$f(0)=0-\cos(0)=-1<0$$ and $$f(\frac{\pi}{2})=\frac{\pi}{2}-\cos(\frac{\pi}{2})=\frac{\pi}{2}>0$$
>	2. Using the IVT, we can see that there **must** be a real number $c$ in $[0,\pi/2]$ that satisfies $f(c)=0$. Therefore, $f(x)=x-\cos(x)$ has at least one zero.
>2. If $f(x)$ is continuous over $[0,2], f(0)>0$ and $f(2)>0$, can we use the IVT to conclude that $f(x)$ has no zeros in the interval $[0,2]$?
>	1. No. The IVT only allows us to conclude that we can **find** a value between $f(0)$ and $f(2)$; it doesn't allow us to conclude that we can't find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the function $f(x)=(x-1)^2$. It satisfies $f(0)=1>0, f(2)=1>0$, and $f(1)=0$.
>3. For $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}, f(-1)=-1<0$ and $f(1)=1>0$. Can we conclude that $f(x)$ has a zero in the interval $[-1,1]$
>	1. No. The function is not continuous over $[-1,1]$. The IVT does not apply here.
