## Piecewise-Defined Functions

**Piecewise-Defined Functions** use different functions for different parts of their domains. When evaluating a piecewise-defined function for an input, the equation used to determine the output will depend on the value of the input and what _piece_ that input falls into in the function (and the function used to determine the output for that piece).

- Example:
	- $f(x) = 3x + 1$ for $x \geq 2$ AND $f(x) = x^2$ for $x < 2$
