## Intro
---

The previous section walked us through the theory of finite limits at finite numbers. Instead of _evaluating_ limits, we _proved_ limits using the $\epsilon-\delta$ proofs. Now we look at limits involving infinity. There are three:

1. Infinite Limits at Finite Numbers
2. Finite Limits at Infinity
3. Infinite Limits at Infinity

We'll visit each separately, then pull all of them together into a unified theory.

## Infinite Limits at Finite Numbers
---

Limits of the form: $\lim\limits_{x\to 1}\dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}$ are called **infinite limits at finite numbers** because their **limits** approach infinity as **x** approaches a finite number.

To investigate the limit, we stated that $(x-1)^2 \to 0^+$ as $x\to 1$. Thus, $\dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}\to\dfrac{1}{0^+}\to\infty$. Now it's time to prove the limit.

To understand the structure of the proof for infinite limits at finite numbers, we have to look at the $\epsilon-\delta$ proof.

Given $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L$ where $a, L$ are finite, we **require** an epsilon-neighborhood about the **finite** number $L$, and a delta-neighborhood about the **finite** number $a$. The limit we're discussing is **not** finite ($L=\infty$). There is no possibility for us to bound $\infty$ in a small epsilon-neighborhood, so we have to adjust our definition for this type of limit.

While we can see that the function values of $f(x)$ tend to $\infty$, that's not enough to **prove** that $L=\infty$. In this case, the epsilon gauntlet is thrown like this: "I bet you can't get a small enough $\delta$-neighborhood centered at $x=1$ so all values are over a billion." This is the same structure / challenge that we got with **finite limits at finite numbers**.

Instead of "for any given $\epsilon>0$," we are challenged with "for any given $N\ggg0$," where the notation $\ggg$ means "much greater than." Also, instead of a small neighborhood, we are challenged with getting the function values **above or below** some massively large positive or negative number (respectively) $N$.

>>[!Tip] Something to Keep in Mind
>>Remember that if the $L$ is positive, our $f(x)$ has to be **greater than** $L$, if our $L$ is negative, our $f(x)$ has to be **less than** $L$. We're looking to go **beyond** whatever arbitrary marker is set by the problem.

Let's look at an example.

Divide both sides by $N$, then multiply both sides by $(x-1)^2$. The inequality doesn't change direction, we just reordered what terms come first. What we'd normally see is: $\dfrac{1}{N}>(x-1)^2$. This is the same problem, just flipped so we're dealing with the $x$ terms on the left-hand side of the inequality.

## Vertical Asymptotes
---
Here, we formalize the definition of Vertical Asymptotes using calculus.

>[!Example] Definition: Vertical Asymptote
>
>The vertical line $x=a$ is called a **vertical asymptote** of the function $f(x)$ if at least one of the following is true:
>$$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=\infty \qquad \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=-\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\infty \qquad \lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=-\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=\infty \qquad \lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=-\infty$$

An example:

>[!Success] Example: Vertical Asymptote
>
>Prove that $x=-2$ is a vertical asymptote of $f(x)=\ln(x+2)$
>
>**Solution**
>We know the domain (set of inputs) of $f(x)=\ln(x+2)$ is $(-2,\infty)$. To prove $x=-2$ is a vertical asymptote, we only need to consider the one-sided limit ($x\to -2^+$). We want to prove $$\lim_{x\to -2^+}\ln(x+2)=-\infty$$
>

>	- $\forall N\lll0$, $\exists\delta>0$ $\ni$
>	- $0<|x-a|<\delta \implies f(x)<N$
>- Want to arrive at the consequent given the antecedent

>		- Parsing that inequality above - we know that x is larger than -2 and is approaching -2 from the right. Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality gets us $x+2>0$ because $x>-2$
>	- $\ln(x+2)<N\implies x+2<e^N$
>	- $\implies \textrm{ Let }\delta=e^N$
>
>**Proof**
>For $N\lll0$, let $\delta=e^N$. If $0<x-(-2)<\delta$ then:
>- $x+2<e^N$
>- $\implies \ln(x+2)<N$
>- $\implies f(x)<N$
>Thus we have proved the limit $\lim\limits_{x\to-2^+}\ln(x+2)=-\infty$
>Therefore, $x=-2$ is a vertical asymptote of $f(x)=\ln(x+2)$
>
>>[!Tip] More Tips!
>>4. If $x<y$, then $e^x<e^y$. This allows us to rewrite inequalities like $\ln(x+2)<N$ as $e^{ln(x+2)}<e^N \implies x+2<e^N$
>>5. Stating that $\delta=e^N$ may **seem** wrong because typically $\delta$ is **very** small; however, pay close attention to the value of $N$. In this example $N\lll0$ (meaning $e^{-N} \to \dfrac{1}{e^N}$ which is a **very** small number).

## Finite Limits at Infinity
---

Consider $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\tanh(x)$
To evaluate this limit (not prove, but evaluate), we did:
- $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\tanh(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}$
- $=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{x}}{\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}}$
- $=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}$
- $=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{1-e^{-2x}}{1+e^{-2x}}$
- $=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{1-\frac{1}{e^{2x}}}{1+\frac{1}{e^{2x}}}$
- $=\dfrac{1-0}{1+0}$
- $=1$

The second to last step involved assumptions of what happens to $\dfrac{1}{e^{2x}}$ as $x\to\infty$. Now we have to prove this step by considering $$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{1}{e^{kx}}=0 \textrm{ (for }k>0)$$
Which will then prove $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\tanh(x)=1$

This limit is an example of a **finite limit at infinity** because the limits become finite (tend toward a certain output or y-value or horizontal asymptote) as $x$ approaches infinity. To get our proof of a finite limit at infinity, we'll use the $\epsilon-\delta$ proof as a base. In this case $L=0$ **is** finite, but $a=\infty$ **is not** finite. Creating a $\delta$-neighborhood about $a$ makes no sense. We can't **bound $\infty$ in a small delta-neighborhood**. 

This time the gauntlet is thrown on the y-axis, using $y=0+\epsilon, y=0-\epsilon$. As long as $x$ is large enough, $-\epsilon<f(x)<\epsilon$. In fact as long as $x>M$ ($M$ in this case is the equivalent of our $N$ when working **infinite limits at finite numbers**, i.e., when our outputs of $f(x)$ head towards infinity as our inputs head toward a specific number. In those cases, we said the output must be greater than or less than some arbitrarily large or small number, respectively $N\ggg0$ or $N\lll0$).

>
>Let $f(x)$ be defined for all $x>a$. Then we say $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a number $M>0$ such that if $x>M$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.
>
>Stated with symbolic logic: $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$$ means
>$$\forall\epsilon>0, \quad \exists M>0 \quad \ni$$
>$$x>M\implies|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$
>
>Additionally, accounting for the "negative" case, we say: $$\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=L$$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a number $M<0$, such that if $x<M$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.
>

>
>>[!Tip] Tip - Why no $|x-a|$?
>>When coming back to this material, I may wonder "why is there no $0<|x-a|<\delta$ in this definition of a limit?" That's because our $x$ goes off to infinity and therefore we can't bound it into a **small delta-neighborhood**. Because we can't bound our $x$ like that, we can't use the $|x-a|$ part of the $\epsilon-\delta$ proof.
>>Our bounding happens on the _y-axis_ by using the epsilon-neighborhood to say that the **outputs** are within the neighborhood (and therefore the _Limit is within the epsilon-neighborhood_). If our **inputs** (x-values) continue to give us the **same outputs within the neighborhood as the inputs go off to infinity** we're showing that no matter how large our x-value ($x>M$) gets, our **outputs** will remain the same - therefore a specific (finite) limit (output) as our inputs move towards infinity 

Two new **powerful** theorems, also used as examples to show how to use the precise definition of a finite limit at infinity.

>$\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}e^{-x}=0$
>

>- Restate the precise definition of a finite limit at infinity
>	- $\forall\epsilon>0$, $\exists M>0$ $\ni$
>	- $x>M\implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon$

>- Substituting values into the antecedent
>	- $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$
>	- $|e^{-x}-0|<\epsilon \implies e^{-x}<\epsilon$ -- Remember $\dfrac{1}{e^x}>0$
>	- $\implies -x<\ln(\epsilon)$

>	- Let $M=-\ln(\epsilon)$
>
>**Proof**

>- $e^{-x}-0<\epsilon$
>- $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$

>
>>[!Tip] Even More Tips!
>>6. $|e^{-x}|=e^{-x}$ because $e^{-x}>0$
>>7. In the proof above, we found $M=-\ln(\epsilon)$. We have to remember that $-\ln$ is a **logarithmic function**, any negatives mean that it's some number to the negative power - i.e., $\dfrac{1}{e^{\epsilon}}$. This is **not** a negative number.
>>8. If $x>0$, then $|\dfrac{1}{x^p}-0|=\dfrac{1}{x^p}$

## Horizontal Asymptotes
---

We've already introduced the definition of a horizontal asymptote, we'll repeat it here due to the connection with the finite limit at infinity.

>[!Example] Definition: Horizontal Asymptote
>
>The vertical line $y=L$ is called a **horizontal asymptote** of the function $f(x)$ if at least one of the following is true:
>$$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L \quad \textrm{or} \quad \lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=L$$

## Infinite Limits at Infinity
---

Now we need to prove problems like $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}3^x=\infty$

These types of problems are called **infinite limits at infinity** because the function tents to infinity (or negative infinity) and $x$ tends to infinity (or negative infinity).

We'll be using the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of a limit as a base. Also take into account how we solved the previous "infinity" limits and "at infinity" inputs above. Remember that the epsilon-neighborhoods are concerned with the y-values (outputs of a function), and the delta-neighborhoods are concerned with the x-values (inputs of a function). If both are heading towards infinity, we'll likely have to use some form of the $M$ and $N$ definitions we used before ($N\ggg0, N\lll0$ and $x>M, x<M$ depending on the signage of infinity for both the limit and the value that $x$ approaches). We'll see....let's go.

Since both $x$ (input) and the function (output) are approaching infinity, it is impossible for us to say "for any given $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$," because there is no way for us to contain infinity in a small neighborhood (either epsilon- or delta-neighborhoods).

Going back to the $\epsilon$-gauntlet throw down - instead of challenging us to get _within_ a certain neighborhood, they're going to challenge us to get values greater than (or less than) a very large (or very small) number ($N\ggg0, N\lll0$, remember?). We used **the precise definition of an infinite limit at a finite number** to get this in previous examples.

Before we go into the _precise_ definition of an infinite limit at infinity, some pictures:

>>[!Tip] Tip: What happened to the $L$?
>>We 'dropped' the $|x-a|$ as $x\to\infty$ because we can't bound infinity into a small $\delta$-neighborhood. Now we're doing the same thing with $\epsilon$. I didn't call it out when we first encountered it, but calling it out here now because it makes sense now.
>>We're 'dropping' the $L$ from the $\epsilon-\delta$ proof because we can't bound infinity into a small $\epsilon$-neighborhood, so we're dealing directly with the output of $f(x)$.

>>[!Tip] Tip - Understanding the $\epsilon-\delta$ Proof
>>Understanding the $\epsilon-\delta$ proof is **absolutely key here**. All other limits that we're encountering in this section are built off that proof.
>>When we can't 'bound' the y-values (outputs, limits), because our outputs go to infinity, we **have** to drop the "$-L$" **_AND_** the "$\epsilon$" parts of the $\epsilon-\delta$ proof and are left with $f(x)>N$ where $N$ is some arbitrarily super-large number (more shown below).

If the function isn't continuous along the interval we're exploring, we don't currently have a solution to solve the limit.
