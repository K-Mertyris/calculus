Proofs of hyperbolic functions
Secant lines and tangent lines
- Lines are the only graphs that have a slope (curves don't have slopes)
- In order to find the slope of a curve, we need to have two points, create a line, then measure the slope of that line.
	- Secant lines cut across any two points on a curve
	- Tangent lines are lines that are found at **a point** along the curve
	- $f(x) = A \sec(Bx + C) + D$
	- Amplitude = $|A| = \dfrac{2}{3}$
	- Period = $\dfrac{2\pi}{B} = \dfrac{2\pi}{\pi} = 2$
	- Step Size = $\dfrac{Period}{4} = \dfrac{2}{4} = \dfrac{1}{2}$
	- Phase Shift = $\dfrac{-C}{B} = 

A lot of Calculus is about getting closer and closer to a point
