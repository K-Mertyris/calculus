This section covers limits as $x$ tends to $\pm\infty$. These are known collectively as limits at infinity.

## Finite Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes
---

$\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L$ means $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$ as long as $x$ is sufficiently close to $a$. In other words - the **_outputs_** of $f(x)$ get closer to $L$ as $x$ gets closer to $a$ ($f(x\to a)=K \to L$, and $f(a)=L$) We can extend this idea to limits at infinity.

Take the function $f(x)=2+\dfrac{1}{x}$. As the values of $x$ get larger, the values of $f(x)$ approach 2. We say the limit as $x\to\infty$ of $f(x)$ is 2 and write $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=2$.
For $x<0$, as the values of $|x|$ get larger, the values of $f(x)$ approach 2. We say that the limit as $x\to -\infty$ of $f(x)$ is 2 and write $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=2$.

In general terms, for any function $f$, we say the limit as $x\to\infty$ of $f(x)$ is $L$ if $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$ as long as $x$ is sufficiently large. In other words, the limit of a function gets closer and closer to a specific number as the inputs of the function move towards infinity. In that case, we write $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$. The same is true in the opposite case (where $x<0$), in that case, we write $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=L$.

>If the values of $f(x)$ become arbitrarily close to the finite value $L$ as $x$ becomes sufficiently large, we say the function $f$ has a **finite limit at infinity** and write: $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$$

>If the values of $f(x)$ become arbitrarily close to the finite value $L$ for $x<0$ as $|x|$ becomes sufficiently large, we say that the function $f$ has a finite limit at negative infinity and write: $$\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=L$$

>If the values of $f(x)$ are getting arbitrarily close to some finite value $L$ as $x\to\infty$ or $x\to -\infty$, the graph of $f$ approaches the line $y=L$. In that case, the line $y=L$ is a horizontal asymptote of $f$. For example, for the function $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}$, since $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=0$, the line $y=0$ is a horizontal asymptote of $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}$.

And...

>[!Note] Definition: Horizontal Asymptote
>
>If $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$ or $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=L$, we say the line $y=L$ is a **horizontal asymptote** of $f$.

Keep in mind that a function **cannot** cross a **_vertical asymptote_** but it **can** cross a **_horizontal asymptote_** an unlimited number of times. $f(x)=\dfrac{\cos x}{x}+1$ is a good example.

## Revisiting the Limit Laws
---

Before we evaluate finite limits at infinity without using tables of values, let's revisit the Limit Laws:

>[!Example]- Theorem: Limit Laws for Limits at Infinity
>
>Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be defined for all $x>a$, where $a$ is a real number. Assume that $L$ and $M$ are real numbers such that $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}g(x)=M$. Let $c$ be a constant.
>
>**Sum and Difference Laws for Limits:** $$\lim_{x\to\infty}(f(x)\pm g(x))=\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)\pm \lim_{x\to\infty}g(x)=L\pm M$$
>**Constant Multiple Law for Limits:** $$\lim_{x\to\infty}cf(x)= c\cdot\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)= cL$$
>**Product Law for Limits:** $$\lim_{x\to\infty}(f(x)\cdot g(x))= \lim_{x\to\infty}f(x) \cdot \lim_{x\to\infty}g(x) = L \cdot M$$
>**Quotient Law for Limits:** $$\lim_{x\to\infty}\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \dfrac{\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)}{\lim_{x\to\infty}g(x)}= \dfrac{L}{M}$$ for $M\not=0$
>**Power Law for Limits:** $$\lim_{x\to\infty}(f(x))^n=(\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x))^n=L^n$$ for every positive integer $n$
>**Root Law for Limits:** $$\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{f(x)}= \sqrt[n]{\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{L}$$ for all $L$ if $n$ is odd and for $L\ge 0$ if $n$ is even.
>
>Each of these Limit Laws can be adjusted for $x\to -\infty$ as long as $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined for all $x<a$, where $a$ is a real number.

Now we add a "lemma"

>$$\lim_{x\to -\infty}x=-\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to \pm\infty}\dfrac{1}{x}=0$$
