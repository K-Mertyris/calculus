Trig functions are used to model many things - sound waves, vibrations of strings, elecritcal current, motion of pendulums. Almost any repetitive or cyclical motion can be modeled by some combination of trig functions.

## Radian Measure
---

To use trig functions, we must understand how to measure the angles. **Radians** are a more natural measurement because they are related directly to the **unit circle** (a circle with radius 1). Given an angle $\theta$, let $s$ be the length of the corresponding arc on the unit circle. The angle corresponding to the arc of length 1 has radian measure 1 (i.e. when the distance from the center of the circle to the 'edge' of the circle (the radius) is the same as the arc length $s$, the _angle that creates that ratio_ is 1 radian in measure).

Table of angles - degrees and radians:

|Degrees|Radians|
|-|-|
|0|0|
|30|$\dfrac{\pi}{6}$|
|45|$\dfrac{\pi}{4}$|
|60|$\dfrac{\pi}{3}$|
|90|$\dfrac{\pi}{2}$|
|120|$\dfrac{2\pi}{3}$|
|135|$\dfrac{3\pi}{4}$
|150|$\dfrac{5\pi}{6}$|
|180|$\pi$|

## The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions

Trig functions allow us to use angle measures (radians or degrees) to find the coordinates of a point on any circle or to find an angle given a point on a circle. They also define the relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle.

>Let $P=(x,y)$ be a point on the unit circle centered at the origin $O$. Let $\theta$ be an angle with an initial side along the positive x-axis and a terminal side given by the line segment $OP$. The trig functions are defined as:

>- $\cos\theta=x$

>- $\csc\theta=\dfrac{1}{y}$
>- $\sec\theta=\dfrac{1}{x}$
>- $\cot\theta=\dfrac{x}{y}$
>
>If $x=0$, $\sec\theta$ and $\tan\theta$ are undefined. If $y=0$, then $\cot\theta$ and $\csc\theta$ are undefined.

## Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions
---

The values of trigonometric functions repeat every $2\theta$ (the $x,y$ coordinates are the same). Trig functions are also known as **periodic functions** (they repeat values along a certain **period** / interval). 

The period of a function $f$ is defined to be the smallest positive value $p$ such that $f(x+p)=f(x)$ for all values $x$ in the domain of $f$. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have a period of $2\pi$, the tangent and cotangent functions have a period of $\pi$.

We can apply transformations to trig functions.

- General form:
	- $f(x)=A\sin(B(x-\alpha)) + C$
	- $\alpha$ = phase (horizontal) shift
	- $B$ = change in period by $\dfrac{2\pi}{|B|}$
	- $A$ = vertical stretch by a factor of $|A|$ (also known as the **amplitude**)
	- $C$ = vertical shift

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions
---

The six basic trig functions are periodic, and are not one-to-one unless domain restricted. When the domain is restricted, we can define the function's inverse.

When evaluating an inverse trig function, the output is an angle. For example, to evaluate $\cos^{-1}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{2}\bigg)$, we need to find an angle $\theta$ such that $\cos\theta = \dfrac{1}{2}$. Given the definition of $\cos^{-1}$, we need the angle $\theta$ that not only solves this equation, but also lies in the interval $[0,\pi]$. We conclude that $\cos^{-1}\bigg(\dfrac{1}{2}\bigg)=\dfrac{\pi}{3}$.
Special attention is needed when dealing with composite trig functions.

- Examples:
	- $\sin\bigg(\sin^{-1}\bigg(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\bigg)\bigg) = \sin\bigg(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\bigg)=\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
	- $\sin^{-1}(\sin(\pi)) = \sin^{-1}(0)=0$ 

The reason why the second inverse didn't come out as planned was because our value of $\sin(\pi)$ wasn't domain restricted. Remember that trig functions are periodic functions - there are two times when the unmodified function $\sin(x)=0$, at $\pi$ and $0$. The inverse sine function in this case is domain restricted to $\bigg[-\dfrac{\pi}{2}, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\bigg]$.
