The derivative of a function at a given point gives us the rate of change or slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. If we differentiate a position function at a given time, we obtain the velocity at that time. In this section we define the derivative function and learn a process for finding it.

## Derivative Functions
---

The derivative function gives the derivative of a function at each point in the domain of the original function for which the derivative is defined. We can formally define a derivative function as follows.

>[!Note] Definition: Derivative Function
>
>Let $f$ be a function. The **derivative function**, denoted by $f'$, is the function whose domain consists of those values of $x$ such that the following limit exists: $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

A function $f(x)$ is said to be **differentiable at $a$ if $f'(a)$ exists**. More generally, a function is said to be **differentiable on $S$** if it is differentiable at every point in an open set $S$, and a differentiable function is one in which $f'(x)$ exists on its domain.

>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\dfrac{x+h-x}{h(\sqrt{x+h}+\sqrt{x})}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x+h}+\sqrt{x}}$
>- $=\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$ - by direct substitution

## Notations for the Derivative
---

There is no single uniform notation for differentiation. Various notations for the derivative of a function or variable have been proposed by various mathematicians. The usefulness of each varies with the context they're used in, and sometimes it is good to use more than one in a given context.

### Lagrange's Notation: $f'(x)$
---

One of the most common modern notations - named after Joseph Louis Lagrange. Invented by Euler and popularized by Lagrange.

If the derivative is evaluated at $x=a$, then the value is written as $f'(a)$ or $y'(a)$.

### Leibniz's Notation: $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$
---

Original notation employed by Gottfried Leibniz, still used frequently today. Particularly common when the equation $y=f(x)$ is regarded as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables $y$ and $x$. Leibniz's notation makes this relationship explicit by writing the derivative as $$\dfrac{dy}{dx}\text{ common alternative forms are }\dfrac{df(x)}{dx}, \dfrac{df}{dx}(x), \text{ and } \dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)$$
To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant lines are often expressed in the form of $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ where $\Delta y$ is the difference in the $y$ values corresponding to the difference in the $x$ values, which are expressed as $\Delta x$. The derivative, which can be thought of as the instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$, is expressed as: $$\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
If the derivative is evaluated at $x=a$, then the value is written as $\dfrac{dy}{dx}\bigg|_{x=a}$ or $\dfrac{df}{dx}\bigg|_{x=a}$

>[!Warning] Caution
>
>When using Leibniz's notation to find the derivative of $y=f(x)$ at $x=a$, it is incorrect to write $\dfrac{df(x)}{dx}$. This will be covered in the next chapter.

### Euler's Notation: $D$
---

Leonhard Euler's notation uses a differential operator suggested by Louis François Antoine Arbogast, denoted as $D$. When applied to a function $f(x)$, it is defined by $$(Df)(x)$$ Not used in this class.

### Newton's Notation: 
---

Isaac Newton's notation for differentiation (also called the dot notation, fluxions, or sometimes the flyspeck notation for differentiation) places a dot over the dependent variable. That is, if $y$ is a function of $t$, then the derivative of $y$ with respect to $t$ is $$ẏ$$
This notation is popular in physics and mathematical physics. It also appears in areas of mathematics connected with physics such as differential equations. Not used in this class.

## Graphing a Derivative
---

We know how to graph a function, given the equation of a function or the equation of a derivative function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the graphs of these two functions, since $f'(x)$ gives the rate of change of a function $f(x)$.

In one of the previous examples, we found that for $f(x)=\sqrt{x}, f'(x)=\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$. If we could graph these functions on the same axes, we can use the graphs to undersetand the relationshiop between these two functions. $f(x)$ is increasing over its entire domain, this means the slopes of the tangent lines at all points are positive. We expect $f'(x)>0$ for all values of $x$ in its domain. As $x$ increases, the slopes of the tangent lines to $f(x)$ are decreasing and we expect to see a corresponding decrease in $f'(x)$. $f(0)$ is undefined and $\lim\limits_{x\to0^+}f'(x)=\infty$, corresponding to a vertical tangent to $f(x)$ at 0.

## Derivatives and Continuity
---

Now that we can graph a derivative, let's examine the behaviors of the graphs. First, we consider the relationship between differentiability and continuity. We will see that if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous there; however, a function that is continuous at a point need not be differentiable at that point. In fact, a function may be continuous at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.

>[!Example] Theorem: Differentiability Implies Continuity
>
> Let $f(x)$ be a function and $a$ be in its domain. If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$.
> 
> **Proof**
> If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f'(a)$ exists and, if we let $h=x-a$, we have $x=a+h$, and as $h=x-a\to0$, we can see that $x\to a$
> 
> Then $$f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$ can be rewritten as $$f'(a)=\lim_{x\to a}\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
> 
> We want to show that $f(x)$ is continuous at $a$ by showing that $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$. Thus:
> 
> - $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to a}(f(x)-f(a)+f(a))$
> - $=\lim\limits_{x\to a}\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\cdot(x-a)+f(a)$
> - $=\bigg(\lim\limits_{x\to a}\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\bigg)\cdot\big(\lim\limits_{x\to a}(x-a)\big)+\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(a)$
> - $f'(a)\cdot 0 + f(a)$
> - $f(a)$
> 
> Therefore, since $f(a)$ is defined and $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$, we conclude that $f$ is continuous at $a$.

We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function $f(x)=|x|$. This function is continuous everywhere; however, $f'(0)$ is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply differentiability. For $f(x)=|x|$, $$f'(0)=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{|x|-|0|}{x-0}=\lim_{x\to0}\dfrac{|x|}{x}$$
This limit does not exist because $$\lim_{x\to 0^-}\dfrac{|x|}{x}=-1 \text{ and } \lim_{x\to 0^+}\dfrac{|x|}{x}=1$$
In observing different functions, we find:
1. We observe that if a function is not continuous, it cannot be differentiable, since every differentiable function must be continuous. However, if a function is continuous, it may still fail to be differentiable.
2. We saw that $f(x)=|x|$ failed to be differentiable at 0 because the limit of the slopes of the tangent lines on the left and right were not the same. Visually, this resulted in a sharp corner on the graph of the function at 0. From this we conclude that in order to be differentiable at a point, a function must be "smooth" at that point.
3. As we saw in the example of $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ a function fails to be differentiable at a point where there is a vertical tangent line.
4. As we saw with $f(x)=\begin{cases} x\sin(\frac{1}{x}), & \text{if }x\not= 0 \\ 0, & \text{if } x=0 \end{cases}$ a function may fail to be differentiable at a point in more complicated ways as well.

>[!Success] Example: A Piecewise Function that is Continuous and Differentiable
>
>A toy company wants to design a track for a toy car that starts out along a parabolic curve and then converts to a straight line. The function that describes the track is to have the form $f(x)=\begin{cases} \frac{1}{10}x^2+bx+c, & \text{if } x<-10 \\ -\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{5}{2}, & \text{if }x\ge -10 \end{cases}$ where $x$ and $f(x)$ are in inches. For the car to move smoothly along the track, the function $f(x)$ must be both continuous and differentiable at $-10$. Find values of $b$ and $c$ that make $f(x)$ both continuous and differentiable.
>
>**Solution**
>For the function to be continuous at $x=-10$, $\lim\limits_{x\to -10}f(x)=f(-10)$. Since $$\lim\limits_{x\to -10}f(x)=\dfrac{1}{10}(-10)^2-10b+c=10-10b+c$$ and $f(-10)=5$, we must have $10-10b+c=5$. Equivalently, we have $c=10b-5$.
>
>For the function to be differentiable at $-10$: $$f'(10)=\lim\limits_{x\to -10}\dfrac{f(x)-f(10)}{x-(-10)}$$ must exist. Since $f(x)$ is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this limit from the right and the left and then set them equal to each other:
>
>- $\lim\limits_{x\to -10^-}\dfrac{f(x)-f(-10)}{x-(-10)}=\lim\limits_{x\to -10^-}\dfrac{\frac{1}{10}x^2+bx+c-5}{x+10}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to -10^-}\dfrac{\frac{1}{10}x^2+bx+(10b-5)-5}{x+10}$ - replacing our $c$ with what we determined from above.
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to -10^-}\dfrac{x^2-100+10bx+100b}{10(x+10)}$ - multiplying by $\frac{10}{10}$ to get rid of the fraction
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to -10^-}\dfrac{(x+10)(x-10+10b)}{10(x+10)}$
>	- Need to work this one out on paper, the factoring isn't clear to me
>- $=b-2$
>
> We also have as $x\to -10^+$:
> 
>- $\lim\limits_{x\to -10^+}\dfrac{f(x)-f(-10)}{x-(-10)}=\lim\limits_{x\to -10^+}\dfrac{-\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{5}{2}-5}{x+10}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to -10^+}\dfrac{-(x+10)}{4(x+10)}$
>- $=-\dfrac{1}{4}$
>
>This gives us $b-2=-\frac{1}{4}$. Thus $b=\frac{7}{4}$ and $c=10(\frac{7}{4})-5=\frac{25}{2}$

## Higher-Order Derivatives
---

The derivative of a function is itself a function, so we can find the derivative of a derivative. For example, the derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as **higher-order derivatives**. The notation for the higher-order derivatives of $y=f(x)$ can be expressed in any of the following forms: $$f''(x), f'''(x), f^{(4)}(x), ... , f^{(n)}(x)$$$$y''(x), y'''(x), y^{(4)}(x), ... , y^{(n)}(x)$$
$$\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2},\dfrac{d^3y}{dx^3},\dfrac{d^4y}{dx^4},...,\dfrac{d^ny}{dx^n}$$

It is interesting to note that the notation for $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ may be viewed as an attempt to express $\dfrac{d}{dx}\bigg(\dfrac{dy}{dx}\bigg)$ more compactly.
