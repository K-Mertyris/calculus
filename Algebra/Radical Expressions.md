The concepts behind simplifying radicals.

## Prerequisites
---
- Exponents
- Radicals

## Theorem
---
- $\sqrt[n]{ab}=\sqrt[n]{a}\cdot\sqrt[n]{b}$ for $a,b\ge 0$ or for any $a,b$ if $n$ is odd
- $\sqrt[n]{\dfrac{a}{b}}=\dfrac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}$ for $a\ge0$ and $b>0$

>[!Warning] No Splitting Addition / Subtraction Under a Radical

>Don't do it!
>
>$\sqrt[n]{a+b}\not=\sqrt[n]{a}+\sqrt[n]{b}$
>$\sqrt[n]{a-b}\not=\sqrt[n]{a}-\sqrt[n]{b}$

## Simplifying Radical Expressions
---

A radical expression is simplified if:
- Each factor in the radicand is less than the index of the radical
- Radicand contains no factions or negative numbers
- Each term contains only one radical
