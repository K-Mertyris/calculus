## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to capture and rewrite notes from my Calculus 1 class, specifically Functions and Graphs information. Each sub-section will have its own set of notes, the goal is to make my notes as atomic as possible so I can link and see relationships between concepts as I progress through the class.

## Links

1. [[Function Basics]]
2. Function Classes
3. Trigonometric Functions
4. Inverse Functions
5. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
