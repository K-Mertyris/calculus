## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to capture notes relating to the basics of functions:
* Formal definition of functions
* How functions are represented
	* Tables
	* Formulas
	* Graphs
* Formal notation of functions
* Terms related to functions
* Composition of functions
* Symmetry properties

## Functions

A function is a special type of relation between sets of numbers. The relation is such that each element of the first set is related to **exactly one** element of the second set.
The element of the first set is called the **input**, the element of the second set is called the **output**.
For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say that the **output is a function of the input**.
* Examples:
	* Area of a square = determined by side length.
		* Area (output) = function of side length (input)
	* Velocity of ball thrown in air = amount of time the ball is in the air
		* Velocity (output) = function of time the ball is in the air
	* Cost of mailing a package = determined by weight of package
		* Cost (output) = function of the weight of the package

>[!Definition]
> A **function** $f$ is made up of three parts:
> 1. Set of inputs
> 2. Set of outputs
> 3. Rule for assigning each input to exactly one output

>[!Definition]
> The **domain** of a function is the set of inputs for a function
> Oftentimes the inputs are associated with the variable $x$ and the inputs are also called the **independent variable**

>[!Definition]
>The **range** of a function is the set of outputs for a function
>Oftentimes the outputs are associated with the variable $y$ and the outputs are also called the **dependent variable**

When functions are described as an equation ($f(x) = x^2$), the domain (set of inputs) is inferred to be the set of all real numbers $x$ where $f(x)$ is a real number. When domains have an infinite number of elements, we describe the set of infinite elements, we use set-builder / interval notation:
- {$x$|$x$ has some property}
- {$x$|$1 < x < 5$}
- ($1, 5$)
- $[1, 5]$

### Piecewise-Defined Functions

**Piecewise-Defined Functions** use different functions for different parts of their domains. When evaluating a piecewise-defined function for an input, the equation used to determine the output will depend on the value of the input.
