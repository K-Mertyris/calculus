## Problems
---

All problems are practice for Algebra and Precalculus courses. The content covered in this homework is meant to use existing knowledge to solve problems similar to what's seen in Calculus. Only the problems are copied below because I need to continually practice them instead of just looking up the answers.

This homework assignment is from a Calculus class with content pulled from the [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1) book found on OpenStax.

1. Provide a rigorous proof of the statement. 
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to-11}\dfrac{1}{(x+11)^4}=\infty$
2. Provide a rigorous proof of the statement.
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+}\ln(x)=-\infty$
3. Prove, using the precise definition of a finite limit at infinity, that:
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty}\dfrac{1}{x^3}=0$
4. Prove, using the precise definition of an infinite limit at infinity, that:
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty}7x^5=-\infty$
5. Provide a rigorous proof of the statement.
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty}e^x=0$
6.
