The formal definiton of a limit (as we know it today) did not appear until the late 19th century. We will follow the same journey, understanding limits intuitively, then by the formal definition. Limits help to express the behavior of graphs (and functions) as they approach some number.

## Finite Limit at a Finite Number
---

Using the function $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}$, we want to see how it behaves around $x=2$. As the values of $x$ approach 2 from either side of 2, the values of $y=f(x)$ approach 4. We say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 2 is 4: $$\lim_{x\to2}f(x)=4$$
From here, we start to develop an intuitive definition of the finite limit at a finite number. We can think of the limit of a function at a **finite number** $a$ as being the real finite number $L$ (the _finite limit_) that the functional values approach as the x-values approach $a$, provided $L$ exists.

>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a finite number $a$, with $a$ being a possible exception to the interval, and let $L$ be a finite real number. If all values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number $L$ as the values of $x$ approach $a$ (but never equal $a$), then we say that the **finite limit** of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches the **finite number** $a$ is $L$. We express this idea as: $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$

This section explores how to _estimate_ the value of a limit using tables and graphs.
