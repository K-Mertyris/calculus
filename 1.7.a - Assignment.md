## Problems
---

All problems are practice for Algebra and Precalculus courses. The content covered in this homework is meant to use existing knowledge to solve problems similar to what's seen in Calculus. Only the problems are copied below because I need to continually practice them instead of just looking up the answers.

This homework assignment is from a Calculus class with content pulled from the [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1) book found on OpenStax.

1. Trigonometric functions are based on the unit circle. The hyperbolic functions are based on which conic section?
2. Evaluate the given function. Give an exact answer.
	1. $\coth(\ln(13))$
3. Evaluate the given function. Round any decimal answers to 3 places, keep fractions exact (problems with ln).
	1. $\sinh(1)=$
	2. $\cosh(ln(5))=$
	3. $tanh(16)=$
4. Evaluate the given function. Round your answer to 3 decimal places if necessary or give an exact answer (problems with ln)
	1. $\cosh(-3)=$
	2. $\operatorname{csch}(ln(6)) =$
5. Match the following to create correct hyperbolic function identities and inverse hyperbolic function definitions
	1. $\coth^{-1}(x)$
	2. $\cosh(x)+\sinh(x)$
	3. $1-tanh^2(x)$
	4. $\cosh(-x)$
	5. $\sinh^{-1}(x)$
	6. -- $e^x$
	7. -- $\operatorname{sech}^2(x)$
	8. -- $\cosh(x)$
	9. -- $\dfrac{1}{2}\ln\bigg(\dfrac{x+1}{x-1}\bigg)$
	10. -- $\ln(x+\sqrt{x^2+1})$
6. Given that $\cosh(x)=\dfrac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$, write a proof that $f(x)=\cosh(x)$ is an even function.
7. Prove the identity.
	1. $\cosh(x+y)=\cosh(x)\cosh(y) + \sinh(x)\sinh(y)$
8. Prove the identity.
	1. $\sinh(x-y)=\sinh(x)\cosh(y)-cosh(x)\sinh(y)$
9. Prove the identity.
	1. $\cosh(2x)=\cosh^2(x)+sinh^2(x)$
10. Prove the identity
	1. $\sinh(2x)=2\sinh(x)\cosh(x)$
