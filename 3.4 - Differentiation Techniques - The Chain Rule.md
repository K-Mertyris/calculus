The techniques we have learned do not allow us to differentiate compositions of functions, such as $h(x)=\sin(x^3)$ or $k(x)=\sqrt{3x^2+1}$. In this section, we study the rule for finding the derivative of the composition of two or more functions.

## Deriving the Chain Rule
---

When we have a fuction that is a composition of two or more functions, we could use all of the techniques we have already learned to differentiate it. However, using all of those techniques to break down a function into simpler parts that we are able to differentiate can get cumbersome. Instead we use the **Chain Rule**, which states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function.

To put this rule into context, let's take a look at an example: $h(x)=\sin(x^3)$. We can think of the derivative of this function with respect to $x$ as the rate of change of $\sin(x^3)$ relative to the change in $x$. Consequently, we want to know how $\sin(x^3)$ changes as $x$ changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As $x$ changes, $x^3$ changes, which leads to a change in $\sin(x^3)$. This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in computing the derivative of $\sin(x^3)$. First of all, a change in $x$ forcing a change in $x^3$ suggests that somehow the derivative of $x^3$ is involved. In addition, the change in $x^3$ forcing a change in $\sin(x^3)$ suggests that the derivative of $\sin(u)$ with respect to $u$, where $u=x^3$, is also part of the final derivative.
