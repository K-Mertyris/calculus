Taking the basics of functions, we can combine them using basic mathematical operations to create new functions. There are two ways to combine functions covered here - combining using mathematical operations and combining using function composition.

## Combining Functions with Mathematical Operators

To combine functions using mathematical operators, write the functions with the operator and simplify. Examples below using two functions $f$ and $g$:
1. Sum: $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
2. Difference: $(f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$
3. Product: $(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x)g(x)$
4. Quotient: $\bigg(\dfrac{f}{g} \bigg)(x) = \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ for $g(x) \not = 0$
