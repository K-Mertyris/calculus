Functions are represented using one or more tools:
1. Tables
2. Graphs
3. [Formulas](obsidian://open?vault=calculus&file=Formal%20Definition%20of%20Functions) 

## Tables

---

Functions can be described using a **table of values** (think Excel, Google Sheets, or any other spreadsheet program). Within the table, there should be a clear correlation betweent the inputs and the outputs - temperature as a function of time, distance as a function of time, total budget as a function of revenue, etc. It may be tough to get a clear picture of the function's behavior by looking at just the data, depending on the quality, quantity, and obvious trends in the dataset / function.

## Graphs

---

We can represent the inputs and outputs of a function on a graph as well. We do this by mapping the inputs to the $x$ coordinate and the outputs to the $y$ coordinate. Sometimes mapping the inputs and outputs of a function to a graph can help us see trends in the data more easily than a table.

### Algebraic Formulas

Given an algebraic formula for a function $f$, the graph of $f$ is the set of points $(x, f(x))$, where $x$ is in the domain of $f$ and $f(x)$ is in the range. To graph the inputs and outputs of a function, it can be helpful to first create a table of inputs and outputs.

>[!Definition]
>**Zeros of a function** - the values of $x$ where $f(x) = 0$
>The **zeros** determine where the graph of $f$ intersects the x-axis

>[!Definition]
>**Y-intercept** - the point where the graph of $f$ intersects the y-axis; given by $(0, f(0))$

It is important to note that a **function** by definition has exactly one output for each input, which means that a function can have (at most) exactly **one** y-intercept.

>[!Rule]
>**Vertical Line Test** - Given a function $f$, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of $f$ no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.

>A function $f$ is **increasing on the interval _I_** if for all $x_1, x_2, \in I$, 
>$f(x_1)\leq f(x_2)$ when $x_1 < x_2$

>A function $f$ is **strictly increasing** on the interval **_I_** if for all $x_1, x_2 \in I$,
>$f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ when $x_1 < x_2$

>A function $f$ is **decreasing on the interval _I_** if for all $x_1, x_2 \in I$,
>$f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$
