## Linear Functions and Slope

Linear functions follow the form of $f(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. If $a>0$, the graph of the line rises as $x$ increases. If $a<0$, the graph of the line falls as $x$ increases. If $a=0$, the line is horizontal.

>Linear functions: $f(x)=ax+b$
>- If $x>0$, $f(x)=ax+b$ is increasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$
>- If $x<0$, $f(x)=ax+b$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$
>- If $a=0$, the line is horizontal
>
>Slope-intercept form:
>- $f(x)=mx+b$
>	- Where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept

>Point-slope equation:

>Standard form of a line:

The graph of any **_linear_** function is a **_line_**. A key feature of a line is its **_slope_**.

>[!Definition]
>**Slope**: The change in $y$ for each unit change in $x$.
>- Slope measures steepness (change per unit) AND direction (positive, negative, or horizontal)
>- To calculate the slope of a line, use the ratio of change in $y$ versus the change in $x$
>	- Take two points on the line $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$
>	- $m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
>	- This ratio is independent of the points chosen because the slope of a **_linear function_** is **constant**

## Polynomials

Polynomial functions follow the form of $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0$ for some integer $n\ge0$ and constants $a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_0$ where $a_n \not= 0$. In the case when $n=0$, we allow for $a_0 = 0$; if $a_0 = 0$, the function $f(x)=0$ is called the **zero function**. The value $n$ is called the **degree** of the polynomial; the constant $a_n$ is called the **leading coefficient**. A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a **constant function**. A polynomial of degree 2 is called a **quadratic function**. A quadratic function has the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \not = 0$. A polynomial function of degree 3 is called a **cubic function**.

TODO: Need to come back later and rewrite this section

## Power Functions

A power function has the form of $f(x) = ax^b$ where $a, b$ are any real numbers.

## Behavior at Infinity

To see how a functijon behaves as inputs ($x$) approach infinity, we look at the values ($y$ or $f(x)$) as the inputs ($x$) get larger. For some functions, the values of $f(x)$ approach a finite number. In those cases we write $f(x) \to$ `<some number>` as $x \to \infty$. The line at $y =$ `<some number>` is a **horizontal asymptote** for the function.

For other functions, $f(x)$ may approach infinity as $x$ grows larger. For those cases, we write $f(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$. We describe what happens to the values of $f(x)$ as $x \to \infty$ and as $x \to -\infty$ as the **end behavior** of the function.

- Consider a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
	- If $a>0$, the values $f(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to \pm \infty$.
	- If $a < 0$, the values $f(x) \to -\infty$ as $x \to \pm \infty$ 
- Consider a cubic function $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$
	- If $a > 0$, then $f(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$ and $f(x) \to -\infty$ as $x \to -\infty$
	- If $a<0, then $f(x) \to -\infty$ as $x\to\infty$ and $f(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to-\infty$
- The **leading term of the polynomial determines the end behavior**
	- This is due to the 'size' of the leading term as the graph approaches infinity. A number cubed will be larger than that number squared as the number continues to grow larger (approaches infinity).

## Zeros of Polynomial Functions

To determine wher a function $f$ intersects the x-axis, we need to solve the equation $f(x)=0$ for $x$.
- For linear functions, $f(x) = mx + b$, the x-intercept is given by solving $mx + b = 0$
- For quadratic functions, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we have to find the zeros of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. When we can't easily factor the polynomial, we have to use the quadratic equation

>[!Theorem: Quadratic Formula]
>Quadratic equation: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a \not= 0$
>The solutions are given by the Quadratic Formula:
>- $x = \dfrac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
>	- If the **discriminant** $b^2 - 4ac > 0$
>	- If $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, there is only one solution, and it is a real number
>	- If $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, no real numbers satisfy the quadratic equation

## Mathematical Models

A mathematical model is a method of simulating real-life situations with mathematical equations. Often used to predict or 'model' expected behavior when certain conditions are present.

## Algebraic Functions

An algebraic function is one that involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rational powers, and roots. Two types of algebraic functions are rational functions and root functions.

A **rational function** is any function that has the form $f(x) = \dfrac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials.
- Examples:
	- $f(x)=\dfrac{3x-1}{5x+2}$
	- $g(x)=\dfrac{4}{x^2+1}$

A **root function** is a power function that has the form $f(x) = x^{1/n}$ where $n > 1$. By allowing for compositions of root and rational functions, we can create other algebraic functions.

- Examples:
	- $f(x)=x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x}$
	- $g(x) = x^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{x}$

Root functions ($f(x) = x^{1/n}$) have defining characteristics depending on whether $n$ is odd or even.

- For all even integers $n \ge 2$
	- The domain of $f(x) = x^{1/n}$ is the interval $[0, \infty)$
- For all odd integers $n\ge1$
	- The domain of $f(x) = x^{1/n}$ is the set of all real numbers

## Piecewise-Defined Functions

Sometimes a function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its domain. Functions with this property are known as **piecewise-defined functions**. The absolute value function ($f(x)=|x|$) is an example of a piecewise-defined function because the formula changes with the sign of $x$.

To graph a piecewise-defined function, we graph each part of the function in its respective domain, on the same coordinate system. If the formula is different for $x<a$ and $x>a$, we need to pay attention to what happens at $x=a$ when we graph the function.

## Transformations of Functions

A shift horizontally or vertically is a type of **transformation of a function**. Other transformations include horizontal and vertical scalings, and reflections about the axes.

**Vertical shifts** happen when we add or subtract the same constant to each output $y$.
- For $c>0$, the graph of $f(x) + c$ is a shift of the graph of $f(x)$ up $c$ units
- For $c > 0$ the graph of $f(x) - c$ is a shift of the graph of $f(x) down $c$ units
