>**Transcendental functions** are functions that cannot be described by basic algebraic operations. They go 'beyond' (transcend) algebra.

## Exponential Functions
---

Any function in the form $f(x)=b^x$ where $b>0, b\not= 1$ is an exponential function with **base** $b$ and **exponent** $x$. Exponential functions have constant bases and variable exponents.

A function of the form $f(x)=x^b$ for some constant $b$ is a **power function**. It is raising the input to some constant power.

No real notes on this section. Need to revisit my pre-calculus notes and pull from there.

## Graphing Exponential Functions
---

For any base $b>0, b\not=1$ the exponential function $f(x)=b^x$ is defined for all real numbers $x$ and $b^x>0$. The domain of $f(x)=b^x$ is $(-\infty, \infty)$ and the range is $(0,\infty)$.

- To graph $b^x$, we note that for $b>1, b^x$ is increasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$ and $b\to\infty$ as $x\to\infty$ and $b^x \to 0$ as $x\to -\infty$.
- If $0<b<1, f(x)=b^x$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$ and $b^x \to 0$ as $x\to\infty$ whereas $b^x \to \infty$ as $x\to -\infty$

## The Number e

>[!Definition]
>
>The number $e$ is the number that the following equations approaches as the exponent goes toward infinity:

>- As $m\to\infty$
>- $e\approx 2.718282$
>
>The function $f(x)=e^x$ is called the **natural exponential function**.

$e$ is often used in equations that measure exponential growth, like: compounding interest.

## Logarithmic Functions
---

Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions.

The exponential function $f(x)=b^x$ is one-to-one, with domain $(-\infty, \infty)$ and range $(0, \infty)$. Its inverse function is called the **logarithmic function** with base $b$. For any $b>0, b\not= 1$, the logarithmic function with base $b$ ($log_b$), has domain $(0, \infty)$, and range $(-\infty, \infty)$ and satisfies $\log_b(x)=y$ if $b^y=x$.

- Examples:
	- $\log_2(8)=3$
		- $2^3 = 8$
	- $\log_10\bigg(\dfrac{1}{100}\bigg)=-2$
		- $10^{-2}=\dfrac{1}{10^2}=\dfrac{1}{100}$
	- $\log_b(1)=0$
		- $b^0=1$
		- For any base $b>0$
	- $\log_b(b^x)=x$
	- $b^{\log_b(x)}=x$

The most commonly used logarithmic function is the function $\log_e$. Since the function uses natural $e$ as its base, it's called the **natural logarithm**, $\ln(x)$ to mean $\log_e(x)$.

In general, for any base $b>0, b\not=1$, the function $g(x)=log_b(x)$ is symmetric about the line $y=x$ with the function $f(x)=b^x$.

>If $a,b,c>0, b\not=1$ and $r$ is any real number, then:
>
>- Product property

>2. $\log_a(x)=\dfrac{\log_b(x)}{\log_b(a)}$ for any real number $x>0$
>	1. If $b=e$, this equation reduces to $\log_a(x)=\dfrac{\ln x}{\ln a}$
