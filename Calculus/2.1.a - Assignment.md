## Problems
---

All problems are practice for Algebra and Precalculus courses. The content covered in this homework is meant to use existing knowledge to solve problems similar to what's seen in Calculus. Only the problems are copied below because I need to continually practice them instead of just looking up the answers.

This homework assignment is from a Calculus class with content pulled from the [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1) book found on OpenStax.

1. The point $P(3,18)$ lies on the curve $y=x^2+x+6$. If $Q$ is the point $(x,x^2+x+6)$, find the slope of the secant line $PQ$ for the following values of $x$
	1. If $x=3.1$, the slope of $PQ$ is:
	2. If $x=3.01$, the slope of $PQ$ is:
	3. If $x=2.9$, the slope of $PQ$ is:
	4. If $x=2.99$, the slope of $PQ$ is:
	5. Based on the results, guess the slope of the tangent line to the curve at $P(3,18)$
2. A ball is thrown into the air by a baby alien on a planet in the system of Alpha Centauri with a velocity of 34 ft/s. Its height in feet after t seconds is given by $y=34t-23t^2$.
	1. Find the average velocity (up to 7 digits) for the time period beginning when $t=2$ and lasting:
		1. .01 sec:
		2. .005 sec:
		3. .002 sec:
		4. .001 sec:
	2. Estimate the instantaneous velocity when $t=2$:
3. Suppose an arrow is show upward on the moon with a velocity of 32 m/s, then its height in meters after $t$ seconds is given by $h(t)=32t-0.83t^2$. Find the average velocity to four decimal places over the following:
	1. $[4,5]$:
	2. $[4,4.5]$:
	3. $[4,4.1]$:
	4. $[4,4.01]$:
	5. $[4,4.001]$:
4. Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola $y=x^2$ at the point $P(1.1,1.21)$.  Start by calculating the slope of the secant line $PQ$ for different points $Q$ that get closer to the point $P(1.1, 1.21)$. Fill in the table by calculating the slope of the tangent lines through $P$ and the point $Q(x,x^2)$ for the values of $x$ provided in the table below.
	1. Based on the values in the table, the slope of the tangent line should be $m=$
	2. Now that you have the slope $m$ of the tangent line and point $P(1.1,1.21)$ on the tangent line, you can find the equation of the line: $y=$

5. Estimate the slope of the tangent line to $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}$ at $x=0.5$ by finding the slopes of the secant lines through the points listed below (three decimal places):
	1. $(0.3, \frac{1}{0.3}), (0.7,\frac{1}{0.7})$
		1. Secant slope $m_{sec}=$
	2. $(0.4,\frac{1}{0.4}), (0.6,\frac{1}{0.6})$
		1. Secant slope $m_{sec}=$
6. Build a table of slopes of secant lines $m_{sec}$ connecting $\bigg(\dfrac{5\pi}{6},f\bigg(\dfrac{5\pi}{6}\bigg)\bigg)$ to $\bigg(\dfrac{5\pi}{6}+h,f\bigg(\dfrac{5\pi}{6} + h\bigg)\bigg)$ for $f(x)=sin(x)$. Use this to estimate the slope of the tangent line to $f(x)=sin(x)$ at $x=\dfrac{5\pi}{6}$
	1. Estimated slope of the tangent line (to five decimal places):
|$h$|$m_{sec}$|$h$|$m_{sec}$|

|0.1||-0.1||
|0.01||-0.01||
|0.001||-0.001||
|0.0001||-0.0001||

7. Buidl a table of slopes of secant lines connecting $(3,f(3))$ to $(3+h, f(3+h))$ for $f(x)=\cosh(x)$ and use this to estimate the slope of the tangent line to $f(x)=\cosh(x)$ at $x=3$.
	1. Estimated slope of the tangent line (to five decimal places):
|$h$|$m_{sec}$|$h$|$m_{sec}$|
|-|-|-|-|
|0.1||-0.1||
|0.01||-0.01||

|0.0001||-0.0001||
