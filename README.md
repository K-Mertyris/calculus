# Calculus

Calculus notes using Obsidian.

This `README` will be developed over time, but for now the goal is to just
explore different personal knowledge management (PKM) tools using real-life
scenarios. In this case, I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take
notes for my Calculus class this semester.

I'll be taking all my notes in Markdown and will be following the [style
guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html) as closely as
possible, but it seems like Obsidian has its own preferences set up for the
default Markdown style when using the app, so it may not conform 100% to the
style guide (one of the things to consider and iron out in the long run).

For any GitHub-based documents (like this `README`), I'll be using VS Codium as
my editor and using GitHub Desktop to manage the commits, pull requests, and
other version-control features of GitHub.

All notes and assignments are derived from the course. The book used in this
Calculus course can be found on
[OpenStax](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1). No answers to
problems will be found in this GitHub repository, only the problems presented
will be found within my notes.
