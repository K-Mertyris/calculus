Functions are represented using one or more tools:
1. Tables
2. Graphs
3. [Formulas](obsidian://open?vault=calculus&file=Formal%20Definition%20of%20Functions) 

## Tables

Functions can be described using a **table of values** (think Excel, Google Sheets, or any other spreadsheet program). Within the table, there should be a clear correlation betweent the inputs and the outputs - temperature as a function of time, distance as a function of time, total budget as a function of revenue, etc. It may be tough to get a clear picture of the function's behavior by looking at just the data, depending on the quality, quantity, and obvious trends in the dataset / function.
