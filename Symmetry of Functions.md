Some functions have symmetry properties when graphed. These symmetry properties help us understand how the function acts and how it appears when graphed. If we can take the graph, slice it in half and fold it on itself across the y-axis (think about folding a piece of paper along a vertical line) and it matches up perfectly, the function has **symmetry about the y-axis**.

If we can rotate a graph $180 \degree$ about the origin and the graph will look exactly the same, we say that the function has **symmetry about the origin**.

### Symmetry About the Y-Axis

A function $f$ is symmetrical about the y-axis when the points $(x, y), (-x, y)$ exist on the graph. In other words $f(-x) = f(x)$. 

If a function $f$ has this property, we say $f$ is an **even function**.

- Example:
	- $f(x) = x^2$ is even because
	- $f(-x) = (-x)^2 = x^2 = f(x)$

## Symmetry About the Origin

A function $f$ is symmetric about the origin when the points $(x, y), (-x, -y)$ exist on the graph. In other words $f(-x) = -f(x)$.

If a function $f$ has this property, we say $f$ is an **odd function**.

- Example:
	- $f(x) = x^3$ is odd because
	- $f(-x) = (-x)^3 = -x^3 = -f(x)$
