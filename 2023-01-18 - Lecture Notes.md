## Section 1.7 - Hyperbolic Functions

Theorem: Area of a Sector
$A = \dfrac{1}{2}r^2 \theta$
cos and sin are stand-ins for the x, y values in a unit circle

Unit Hyperbola
$x^2 - y^2 = 1$
cosh = hyperbolic cosine
sinh = hyperbolic sine
Trig is defined in terms of half areas, not arc lengths (_s_)
For hyperbolic functions, we're defining our first hyperbolic identity

$x^2 - y^2 = 1$
$x = \cosh(s)$
$y=\sinh(s)$

$\cosh^2(s) - \sinh^2(s) = 1$

Pronounciation:
- cosh = "cosh"
- sinh = "cinch"
- tanh = "tanch"
- csch = "coseech"
- sech = "seech"
- coth = "coth"

These functions are used regularly in Calc 1 and Calc 2

Evaluation of the functions:
- $\sinh(0) = \dfrac{e^0 - e^{-0}}{2}$
- $= \dfrac{1-1}{2} = \dfrac{0}{2} = 0$

$\cosh(t)$ is an EVEN function
$\sinh(t)$ is an ODD function
$\tanh(t)$ is an ODD function $\bigg($remember $\tanh(t) = \dfrac{\sinh(t)}{\cosh(t)}\bigg)$

In Algebra - $\dfrac{1}{0}$ is undefined
In Calculus, we will see
- lim x -> 0 1/x is indeterminate
- x is approaching 0, but will never BE 0

Hyperbolic Identities

Memorize the first two (cosh, sinh)
Prove that for $n \in N, [\cosh(t) + \sinh(t)]^n = \cosh(nt) + sinh(nt)$
- $\bigg[\dfrac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2} + \dfrac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2} \bigg]^n$
- $\bigg[\dfrac{2e^t}{2}\bigg]^n$
- $[e^t]^n$ 
- $e^{nt}$


READ THE TEXTBOOK - Theorem 1.7.1 in the text names all the hyperbolic functions
