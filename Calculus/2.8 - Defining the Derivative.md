## Tangent Lines
---

Time to revisit secant and tangent lines. We used the slope of a secant line to a function at a point $(a, f(a))$ to estimate the rate of change. We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of $x$ near $a$ and drawing a line through the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(x, f(x))$. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the form of a **difference quotient**: $$m_{sec}=\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value $a$ by using this equation and replacing $x$ with $a+h$, where $h$ is a value close to $a$. We then calculate the slop of the line through the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(a+h, f(a+h))$. In this case, we find the seant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with increment $h$: $$m_{sec}=\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a} = \dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$

>[!Definition] Definition: Difference Quotient
>
>Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval $I$ containing $a$. If $x\not= a$ is in $I$, then $$Q=\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ is a **difference quotient**.
>
>Also if $h\not=0$ is chosen so that $a+h$ is in $I$, then $$Q=\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$ is a difference quotient with increment $h$.

Both expressions for calculating the slope of a secant line are shown below. Each of these methods for finding the slope of a secant line have value. Depending on the setting, we can choose one or the other, the one that's chosen usually depends on how easy it is to calculate.

In 2.8.3a, as the values of $x$ approach $a$, the slopes of the secant lines provide better estimates of the rate of change of the funciton at $a$. The secant lines themselves approach the tangent line to the function at $a$, which represents the limit of the secant lines. In 2.8.3b, as the values of $h$ get closer to 0, the secant lines also approach the tangent line. The slope of the tangent line at $a$ is the rate of change of the function at $a$, shown in 2.8.3c.

![[fig-2-8-3.png]]

In fig-2.8.4, we show the graph of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and its tangent line at $(1,1)$ in a series of tighter intervals about $x=1$. As the intervals become narrower, the graph of the function and its tangent line appear to coincide, making the values on the tangent line a good approximation to the values of the function for choices of $x$ close to $1$. The graph of $f(x)$ appears to be **locally linear** in the immediate vicinity of $x=1$.

![[fig-2-8-4.png]]

The formal definition of the tangent line to the graph is below.

>[!Definition] Definition: Tangent Line
>
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $a$. The **tangent line** to $f(x)$ at $a$ is the line passing through the point $(a, f(a))$ having slope $$m_{tan}=\lim_{x\to a}\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ provided this limit exists.
>
>Equivalently, we may define the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $a$ to be the line passing through the point $(a, f(a))$ having slope $$m_{tan}=\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$ provided this limit exists.

The same two equations we used to find the slope of the secant line can be used to find the slope of the tangent line. Now that we have these definitions, we can use them to find equations of tangent lines.

>[!Success] Example: Finding a Tangent Line
>
>Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=3$.
>
>**Solution**
>First find the slope of the tangent line. In this example, use the $f(x)-f(a)$ one:
>- $m_{tan}= \lim\limits_{x\to 3}\dfrac{f(x)-f(3)}{x-3}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to 3}\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$
>- $\lim\limits_{x\to 3}\dfrac{(x-3)(x+3)}{x-3}$
>- $\lim\limits_{x\to 3}\dfrac{\cancel{(x-3)}(x+3)}{\cancel{(x-3)}^1}$
>- $\lim\limits_{x\to 3}(x+3)$
>- $=6$ via direct substitution
>
> Since it's our job to find the **equation** of the line tangent to $f(x)=x^2$, we're not done yet. Since the line is tangent to the graph of $f(x)$ at $x=3$, it passes through the point $(3, f(3))$. We have $f(3)=9$, so the tangent line passes through the point $(3,9)$.
> 
> Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope $m=6$ and the point $(3,9)$, we obtain the line $y-9=6(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $y=6x-9$.

>>[!Tip] In a nutshell
>>The tangent and secant line equations only provide the **slope of the tangent or secant lines**. We **have to** figure out the rest of the equation using algebra and the info we have on hand. Here's a process that can be followed:
>>
>>1. Find the slope of the tangent or secant line using either the $f(x)-f(a)$ or the $f(a+h)-f(a)$ formulas
>>2. Take the original function and plug in the same $x$ (input) that was used to find the slope of the tangent line. That will give us the point where the tangent line intersects with the original function $(x, f(x))$.
>>3. Now that we have a slope and a point, we plug that information into the **point-slope form** of a line: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$
>>4. Draw the line.

## The Derivative of a Function at a Point
---

The type of limit we compute in order to find the slope of the line tangent to a function at a point occurs in many applications across many disciplines. These applications include velocity and acceleration in physics, marginal profit functions in business, and growth rates in biology. This limit occurs so frequently that we give this value a special name: the **derivative**. The process of finding a derivative is called **differentiation**.

>[!Definition] Definition: Derivative
>
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $a$. The **derivative** of the function $f(x)$ at $a$ denoted by $f'(a)$ is defined by $$f'(a)=\lim_{x\to a}\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ provided this limit exists.
>
>Alternatively, we may also define the derivative of $f(x)$ at $a$ as: $$f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$

Now an example.

>[!Success] Example: Finding a Derivative
>
>For $f(x)=3x^2-4x+1$, find $f'(2)$ by using $f(x)-f(a)$
>
>**Solution**
>Substitute the given function and value directly into the equation
>- $f'(2)=\lim\limits_{x\to 2}\dfrac{f(x)-f(2)}{x-2}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to 2}\dfrac{3x^2-4x+1 - (5)}{x-2}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to 2}\dfrac{3x^2-4x-4}{x-2}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to 2}\dfrac{(x-2)(3x+2)}{x-2}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{x\to 2}3x+2$
>- $=8$ via direct substitution

## Velocities and Rates of Change
---

Now that we can evaluate a derivative, it's time to use derivatives in velocity applications. If $s(t)$ is the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis, the **average velocity** of the object over a time interval $[a,t]$ if $t>a$ or $[t,a]$ if $t<a$ is given by the difference quotient: $$v_{avg}=\dfrac{s(t)-s(a)}{t-a}$$
As the values of $t$ approach $a$, the values of $v_{avg}$ approach the **instantaneous velocity** at $a$. That is, instantaneous velocity at $a$ is given by: $$v(a)=s'(a)=\lim\limits_{t\to a}\dfrac{s(t)-s(a)}{t-a}$$
To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see the figure below. IN this figure, the slope of the tangent line is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time $t=a$ whose position at time $t$ is given by the function $s(t)$. The slope of the secant line is the average velocity of the object over the time interval $[a,t]$.

![[fig-2-8-7.png]]

The slope of a tangent line to a function and instantaneous velocity are related concepts. Each is calculated by computing a derivative and each measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, or the rate of change of a function at any point along the function.

>[!Definition] Definition: Instantaneous Rate of Change
>
>The **instantaneous rate of change** of a function $f(x)$ at a value $a$ is its derivative $f'(a)$
