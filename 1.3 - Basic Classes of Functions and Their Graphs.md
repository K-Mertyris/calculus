## Linear Functions and Slope

Linear functions follow the form of $f(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. If $a>0$, the graph of the line rises as $x$ increases. If $a<0$, the graph of the line falls as $x$ increases. If $a=0$, the line is horizontal.

>Linear functions: $f(x)=ax+b$
>- If $x>0$, $f(x)=ax+b$ is increasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$
>- If $x<0$, $f(x)=ax+b$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$
>- If $a=0$, the line is horizontal
>
>Slope-intercept form:
>- $f(x)=mx+b$
>	- Where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept
>
>Point-slope equation:
>- $f(x)-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$
>
>Standard form of a line:
>- $ax + by = c$
>- Where $a, b$ are both non-zero numbers

The graph of any **_linear_** function is a **_line_**. A key feature of a line is its **_slope_**.

>[!Definition]
>**Slope**: The change in $y$ for each unit change in $x$.
>- Slope measures steepness (change per unit) AND direction (positive, negative, or horizontal)
>- To calculate the slope of a line, use the ratio of change in $y$ versus the change in $x$
>	- Take two points on the line $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$
>	- $m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
>	- This ratio is independent of the points chosen because the slope of a **_linear function_** is **constant**

## Polynomials

Polynomial functions follow the form of $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0$ for some integer $n\ge0$ and constants $a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_0$ where $a_n \not= 0$. In the case when $n=0$, we allow for $a_0 = 0$; if $a_0 = 0$, the function $f(x)=0$ is called the **zero function**.
