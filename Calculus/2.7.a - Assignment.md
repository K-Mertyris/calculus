## Problems
---

All problems are practice for Algebra and Precalculus courses. The content covered in this homework is meant to use existing knowledge to solve problems similar to what's seen in Calculus. Only the problems are copied below because I need to continually practice them instead of just looking up the answers.

This homework assignment is from a Calculus class with content pulled from the [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1) book found on OpenStax.

1. The graph below is the function $f(x)$
	1. Determine which of the following explains why continuity is violated at $x=2$
		1. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ and $f(a)$ exist but are unequal
		2. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ does not exist
		3. $f(a)$ is not defined
2. Use the definition of continuity and the properties of limits to show that the function is continuous at $a=3$. Your work should be legible, and all your logic should be clear and justified.
	1. $f(x)=-8x^6+2x+\sqrt[3]{x^4-80}$
3. Use the definition of continuity and the properties of limits to show that the function is continuous on the given interval
	1. $f(x)=\dfrac{x-3}{2x+6}$, on $(-\infty,-3)$
4. Given the function below, determine if the function is continuous at the point $x=-4$. If not, indicate why.
	1. $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-9}{x-3}$
		1. Continuous at $x=-4$
		2. Not continuous: $f(-4)$ is not defined; this is a removable discontinuity
		3. Not continuous: $f(-4)$ is not defined; this is **not** a removable discontinuity
		4. Not continuous: $\lim\limits_{x\to -4}f(x)$ does not exist
		5. Not continuous: $f(-4)$ and limit exist, but are not equal
5. Let $f(x)=\begin{cases} \frac{7}{x} & \quad \text{if } x \le 7 \\ -\frac{1}{x-8} & \quad \text{if } x>7 \end{cases}$
	1. Compute the quantities below. Write DNE if the limit does not exist or the value is undefined.
		1. $\lim\limits_{x\to 7^-}f(x)=$
		2. $\lim\limits_{x\to 7^+}=$
		3. $f(7)=$
		4. Since the above three quantities are (defined but not all equal, all defined and equal, not all defined), we know that $f$ is (continuous, discontinuous) at $x=7$.
		5. List ALL numbers at which $f$ is discontinuous. Be sure to check the functions defined to the left and right of 7 for discontinuities
6. Let $f(x)=\begin{cases}\sqrt{-1-x}+2 & \quad \text{if }x<-2 \\ 3 & \quad \text{if }x=-2\\ 3x+9 & \quad \text{if } x>-2 \end{cases}$
	1. Calculate the following limits. Enter DNE if the limit does not exist.
		1. $\lim\limits_{x\to -2^-}f(x)=$
		2. $\lim\limits_{x\to -2^+}f(x)=$
		3. $\lim\limits_{x\to -2}f(x)=$
	2. Determine whether $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=-2$. If $f(x)$ is not continuous, identify why.
		1. Continuous at $x=-2$
		2. Not continuous at $x=-2: f(a)$ is not defined
		3. Not continuous at $x=-2: \lim\limits_{x\to -2}f(x)$ does not exist
		4. Not continuous at $x=-2:f(a)\not= \lim\limits_{x\to -2}f(x)$

		4. $f(x)$ has a removable discontinuity at $x=2$
7. A function $f(x)$ is said to have a **removable** discontinuity at $x=a$ if:
	1. $f$ is either not defined or not continuous at $x=a$
	2. $f(a)$ could either be defined or redefined so that the new function is continuous at $x=a$
	3. Let $f(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{4}{x}+\frac{-3x+4}{x(x-1)} & \quad \text{if } x\not= 0 \text{ and } x\not= 1 \\ 10 & \quad \text{if }x=0 \end{cases}$
	4. Show that $f(x)$ has a removable discontinuity at $x=0$ and determine what value for $f(0)$ would make $f(x)$ continuous at $x=0$.
	5. Must redefine $f(0)=$
8. The gravitational force exerted by the planet Saturn on an astronaut at a distance $r$ from the center of Saturn is: $$F(r)=\begin{cases} \frac{GMmr}{R^3} & \quad \text{if } r<R \\ \frac{GMm}{r^2} & \quad \text{if } r\ge R \end{cases}$$ where $M$ is the mass of Saturn, $m$ is the mass of the astronaut, $R$ is the radius of Saturn, and $g$ is the gravitational constant. Is $F$ a continuous function of $r$?
9. For what value of the constant $c$ is the function $f$ continuous on $(-\infty,\infty)$ where $f(x)=\begin{cases}cx+1 & \quad \text{if }x\le 5 \\ cx^2-1 & \quad \text{if } x> 5 \end{cases}$
	1. $c=$
10. If $f$ is a continuous function, and $f(6)=2$, then find the following limits:

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|$f(x)$|-1|12|9|-4|7|

14. If $f(x)=5x^2+3\sin(x)$, give a detailed proof that there is a number $c$ such that $f(c)=1200$. Your work should be legible, and all your logic should be clear and justified.
15. Show how to use the IVT to show that the equation $\cos\bigg(\dfrac{\pi x}{3}\bigg)+1=\dfrac{5}{9}$ has a solution between 0 and 3.
	1. Let $f(x)=\cos\bigg(\dfrac{\pi x}{3}\bigg)+1$. In order for the IVT to apply, we must first check that $f$ is (continuous, solvable, differentiable, a polynomial, a rational function) on the interval $[0,3]$. _You should verify this and be able to explain why it is the case_
		1. We check the value of $f$ at the _left_ endpoint of the interval $[0,3]$
			1. $f(x)=y$,  $x=$`___`, $y=$`___` 
		2. We check the value of $f$ at the _right_ endpoint of the interval $[0,3]$
			1. $f(x)=y$,  $x=$`___`, $y=$`___`
		3. The IVT guarantees a solution to $f(x)=\dfrac{5}{9}$ in the interval $(0,3)$ because:
			1. $f(x)\le$`___`$\le f(x)$
				1. State the values of all three parts of the inequality
16. Prove, using methods taught in this course, that the equation has a solution on the given interval.
	1. $4x^2+3=e^x+5\sqrt{x}$ on the interval $(1,4)$
17. Prove, using methods taught in this course, that $\cos(x)$ is continuous everywhere. You may assume that sine and cosine are both continuous at 0.
18. The following function is discontinuous everywhere except at 0. Write a proof showing that $g$ is continuous at 0.
	1. $g(x)=\begin{cases} 0 & \quad \text{if } x \text{ is rational} \\ 5x^4 & \quad \text{if } x \text{ is irrational} \end{cases}$
19. Evaluate the given limit.
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}(\log_3(x) - \log_3(27x))=$
20. Consider $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}e^{5x-x^2}$
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}5x-x^2=$
	2. If we let $t=5x-x^2$ we can rewrite the original limit as: $\lim\limits_{\text{something 1}\to\text{something 2}}\text{something 3}$
		1. Find the values to substitute in for something 1, 2, 3
	3. Therefore, $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}e^{5x-x^2}=\lim\limits_{s_1 \to s_2}s_3^{s_4}=$
21. Evaluate the limit
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}(2\sin(3x+4)-4)=$
22. The IVT can be used to approximate a root. The following is an example of binary search in computer science. Suppose you want to approximate $\sqrt{3}$. You know that it is between 1 and 2. If you consider the function $f(x)=x^2-3$, then note that $f(1)<0$ and $f(2)>0$. Therefore by the IVT, there is a value $1\le c \le 2$ such that $f(c)=0$. Next choose the midpoint of these two values, 1.5, which is guaranteed to be within 0.5 of the actual root. $f(1.5)$ will either be less than 0 or greater than 0. You can use the IVT again replacing 1.5 with the previous endpoint that has the same sign as 1.5. Continuing this process gives a sequence of approximations $x_n$ with $x_1=1.5$. How many iterations must you do in order to be within 0.0078125 of the root?
