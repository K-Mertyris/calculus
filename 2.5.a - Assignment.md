## Problems
---

All problems are practice for Algebra and Precalculus courses. The content covered in this homework is meant to use existing knowledge to solve problems similar to what's seen in Calculus. Only the problems are copied below because I need to continually practice them instead of just looking up the answers.

This homework assignment is from a Calculus class with content pulled from the [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1) book found on OpenStax.

1. Visit desmos and interact with the graph in order to determine a $\delta$ so that if $|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$. Please make sure your response is accurate to within three decimal places.
   Let $f(x)=3x-1$, and let $x\to4$, and suppose that $\epsilon=.001$.
   Determine $\delta$ so that if $|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$
	
2. The graph of $f(x)=x^5$ is shown below. Find a number $\delta$ such that if $|x-1|<\delta$, then $x^5-1<0.6$.
	
3. Use graphing technology to find a number $\delta$ such that if $x-\dfrac{\pi}{4}<\delta$ then $|\tan(x)-1|<0.7$
	
4. Let $f(x)=x+7$ and set $\epsilon=0.8$
   We wish to show that $f(x)\to12$ as $x\to 5$
   Find the bounds of the widest interval of x-values for which $|f(x)-12|<\epsilon$
	
5. Find a $\delta$ that works for $\epsilon=0.1$ for the following limit:
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to7}-6x+2=-40$
	
6. Find a $\delta$ that works for $\epsilon=0.1$ for the following limit:
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to1} -2(x-6)^3+4=254$
7. A machinist is required to manufacture a circular metal disk with area 763 $cm^2$. Give your answers in exact form. Do not write them as decimal approximations.
	1. Problem Setup:
		1. Function = area of a circle: $\pi r^2$
		2. Our "Limit" (output) is the y-value we're looking for: $763 cm^2$
		3. Our "$x\to a$" (input) is the x-value we have to figure out
		4. Our "$\epsilon$" is the variance allowed: $\pm5cm^2$
		5. Our "$\delta$" is the distance from our anchor point ($a$) to $x$ that we have to figure out
	2. What radius, x, produces such a disk?
	3. If the machinist is allowed an error tolerance of $\pm5$  $cm^2$ in the area of the disk, how close to the ideal radius in part (a) must the machinist control the radius?
	4. Using the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of a limit, determine each of the following values in this context:
		1. $f(x)=$
		2. $a=$
		3. $L=$
		4. $\epsilon=$
		5. $\delta=$

17. Prove the statement using a rigorous $\epsilon-\delta$ proof.
	1. $\lim\limits_{x\to -2}(x^3+5)=-3$

18. A student was asked to prove the following statement using a rigorous $\epsilon-\delta$ proof. $\lim\limits_{x\to 26}\dfrac{1}{x}=\dfrac{1}{26}$
    Suppose that during their scratch work, the student assumed $|x-26|<1$. That is, the student assumed $\delta_1=1$. What is the student's corresponding value for $\delta_2$?


Bonus:
1. $\lim\limits_{x\to3}(x^3-22)=5$
