In this section, we develop rules for finding derivatives that allow us to bypass this process. Beginning with the basics.

## The Basic Rules
---

The functions $f(x)=c$ and $g(x)=x^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer are the building blocks from which all polynomials and rational functions are constructed. To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions efficiently without resorting to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.

### The Constant Rule
---

Applying the limit definition to find the derivative of the constant function $f(x)=c$. For this function, both $f(x)=c$ and $f(x+h)=c$, so we get the following:
- $f'(x)=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{c-c}{h}$
- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{0}{c}$
- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}0$
- $=0$

The rule for differentiating constant functions is called the **Constant Rule**. It states that the derivative of a constant function is zero; since a constant function is a **horizontal line**, the slope (rate of change, $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$) of a constant function is 0. Restating in the following theorem.

>[!Example] Theorem: The Constant Rule
>
>Let $c$ be a constant. If $f(x)=c$, then $f'(x)=0$
>Alternatively, we may express this rule as $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(c)=0$$

Example time!

>[!Success] Example: Applying the Constant Rule
>
>Find the derivative of $f(x)=8$
>
>**Solution**
>This is just a one-step application of the rule: $f'(8)=0$
>
>>[!Note] Heads Up!
>>In the above example, the derivative $f'$ used an example of $f'(8)$. This is easy to confuse with what the rule is actually stating. The rule states that the **slope of the tangent line to a function that is constant is always zero**. This example just **_happened_** to use $f'(8)$ as the number that we plugged into the derivative. It could be $f'(1), f'(548), or f'(\infty)$, all of these individual points would return as **slope** of 0 because the function $f(x)=8$ is a constant function.

### The Power Rule
---

During our exploration of the limit definition of the derivative, we showed that $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^2)=2x \text{ and } \dfrac{d}{dx}(x^{1/2})=\dfrac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}$$
We continue our examination of derivative formulas by differentiating power functions of the form $f(x)=x^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer. Let's take a look at a specific case $\frac{d}{dx}(x^3)$ since the technique used in this case is essentially the same as the technique used to prove the general case.

>[!Success] Example: Differentiating
>
>Find $\frac{d}{dx}(x^3)$
>
>**Solution**
>- $\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^3)=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{(x+h)^3-x^3}{h}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{x^3+3x^2h+3xh^2+h^3-x^3}{h}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{3x^2h+3xh^2+h^3}{h}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{h(3x^2+3xh+h^2)}{h}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{\cancel{h}(3x^2+3xh+h^2)}{\cancel{h}}$
>- $=\lim\limits_{h\to0}(3x^2+3xh+h^2)$
>- $=3x^2$ -- via direct substitution

The procedure for finding the derivative of the general form $f(x)=x^n$ is very similar. Although it is often unwise to draw **general conclusions from specific examples**, we note that when we differentiate $f(x)=x^3$, the derivative becomes the product of the original power and $x$ to a power one less than it was before.

The following theorem states that the **Power Rule** holds for all positive integer powers of $x$

>[!Example] Theorem: The Power Rule (positive integer exponents only)
>
>Let $n$ be a positive integer. If $f(x)=x^n$, then $$f'(x)=nx^{n-1}$$
>Alternatively, we may express this rule as $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}$$
>
>**Proof**
>For $f(x)=x^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer, we have $$f'(x)=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}$$
>Since $$(x+h)^n=x^n+nx^{n-1}h + \big(_2^n\big) x^{n-2}h^2 + \big(_3^n\big) x^{n-3}h^3 +...+ nxh^{n-1} + h^n$$
>we see that $$(x+h)^n-x^n=nx^{n-1}h+\big(_2^n\big)x^{n-2}h^2 + \big(_3^n\big) x^{n-3}h^3 +...+ nxh^{n-1} + h^n$$
>Next, divide both sides by $h$: $$\dfrac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=\dfrac{nx^{n-1}h + \big(_2^n\big)x^{n-2}h^2 + \big(_3^n\big)x^{n-3}h^3 +...+ nxh^{n-1}+h^n}{h}$$
>Thus $$\dfrac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}=nx^{n-1} + \big(_2^n\big)x^{n-2}h + \big(_3^n)x^{n-3}h^2 +...+ nxh^{n-2} + h^{n-1}$$
>Finally, $$f'(x)=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\dfrac(nx^{n-1} + \big(_2^n\big)x^{n-2}h + \big(_3^n\big)x^{n-3}h^2 +...+ nxh^{n-2} + h^{n-1}) = nx^{n-1}$$

>>[!Tip] Neat!
>>This theorem holds true for _all_ powers (not just positive integers) and, despite not being able to prove it at this point in the course, we allow ourselves the luxury of using it in the meantime

>>[!Danger] Caution
>>The Power Rule only applies to algebraic functions of the form $y=x^n$. It does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a variable power, such as $f(x)=3^x$. That is, $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(3^x)\not=x3^{x-1}$$

### The Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules
---

The next set of differentiation rules look at derivatives of sums, differences and constant multiples of functions. These rules are summarized below:

>[!Theorem] Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules
>
>Let $f(x)$ be differentiable functions and $k$ be a constant. Then each of the following equations holds.
>
>**Sum Rule**: The derivative of the sum of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the sum of the derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$. $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)+g(x))=\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))+\dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))$$ that is, $$\text{for }s(x)=f(x)+g(x), \quad s'(x)=f'(x)+g'(x)$$
>
>**Difference Rule:** The derivative of the difference of a function $f$ and a function $g$ is the same as the difference of the derivative of $f$ and the derivative of $g$: $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)-g(x))=\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))-\dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))$$ that is, $$\text{for } \dfrac{d}{dx}d(x)=f(x)-g(x), \quad d'(x)=f'(x)-g'(x)$$
>
>**Constant Multiple Rule:** The derivative of a constant $k$ multiplied by a function $f$ is the same as the constant multiplied by the derivative: $$\dfrac{d}{dx}(kf(x))=k\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))$$ that is, $$\text{for }m(x)=kf(x), \quad m'(x)=kf'(x)$$
>
>**Proof**
>We provide only the proof of the Sum Rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.
>
>For differentiable functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we set $s(x)=f(x)+g(x)$. Using the limit definition of the derivative, we have $$s'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{s(x+h)-s(x)}{h}$$
>
>By substituting $s(x+h)=f(x+h)+g(x+h)$ and $s(x)=f(x)+g(x)$, we obtain: $$s'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{(f(x+h)+g(x+h))-(f(x)+g(x))}{h}$$
>
>Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have: $$s'(x)= \lim_{h\to0} \bigg( \dfrac{ f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}+\dfrac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}\bigg)$$
>
>We now apply the Sum Law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain: $$s'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} + \lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}=f'(x)+g'(x)$$

## Synthesis Topic: Tangent Lines and Their Equations

>[!Success] Finding the equation of a Tangent Line
>
>Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of $f(x)=x^2-4x+6$ at $x=1$
>
>**Solution**
>To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute $$f(1)=1^2-4(1)+6=3$$
>This gives us the point $(1,3)$. Since the slope of the tangent line at 1 is $f'(1)$, we must first find $f'(x)$. Using the definition of a derivative, we have $$f'(x)=2x-4$$ so the slope of the tangent line is $f'(1)=-2$. Using the point-slope formula, we see that the equation of the tangent line is $$y-3=-2(x-1)$$
>Putting the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, we obtain $$y=-2x+5$$

>
>**Solution**
>To find the values of $x$ for which $f(x)$ has a horizontal tangent line, we must solve $f'(x)=0$
>- $f'(x)=6x^2+12x-90$
>- $=6(x^2+2x-15)$
>- $=6(x+5)(x-3)$

>
>Find the values of $x$ for which the tangent to the graph of $f(x)=4x^2-3x+2$ has a tangent line parallel to the line $y=2x+3$
>- Tangent line = $f'$. That tangent line must also have a slope of 2 to match up with the equation $y=2x+3$. Therefore, we must solve for $f'(x)=2$
>- $f'(x)=8x-3$
>- $=8x-3=2$
>- $=x=\frac{5}{8}$
>- At the point $x=\frac{5}{8}$ the slope of the tangent line will equal 2, now we plug $\frac{5}{8}$ in to $f$

>
>For what values $a$ and $b$ is the line $4x+y=b$ tangent to the curve $y=ax^2$ when $x=-4$?
>
>**Solution**
>**_Read carefully_** - we know that for some special values of $a$ and $b$, the line $4x+y=b$ will be tangent to $y=ax^2$ at $x=-4$. This fact implies **two** important pieces of information:
>1. The slope of the line and the slope of the tangent line to the quadratic function will match at $x=-4$
>2. The line and the parabola will share a common point at $x=-4$
>
>**Matching Slopes**
>To find the slope of the line, we place it in slope-intercept form $$y = -4x+b$$ Thus the slope of the line is $-4$
>To find the slope of the tangent line to $y=ax^2$, we compute the derivative $$y'=2ax$$ Evaluating this at $x=-4$, we get $$y'(-4)=-8a$$ Since the slope of the tangent line to the quadratic and the slope of the line are supposed to match at $x=-4$, $$-4=-8a\implies a=\dfrac{1}{2}$$
>
>**Common Point**
>Since the line and the quadratic meet at $x=-4$, their y-values will be the same. That is, at $x=-4$, $-4x+b=ax^2$. Therefore
>- $-4(-4)+b=a(-4)^2 \implies 16+b=\dfrac{1}{2}(16)$
>- $\implies 16+b=8$
>- $\implies b=-8$
>
>Thus for the line and quadratic to meet and be tangent at $x=-4$ we require $a=\frac{1}{2}$ and $b=-8$

## Applications of Differentiation: Physics

As mentioned previously, if $s(t)$ is the position of a particle at time $t$, then its velocity is $$v(t)=\dfrac{ds}{dt}$$ and its acceleration is $$a(t)=\dfrac{dv}{dt}=\dfrac{ds^2}{dt^2}$$

## Applications of Differentiation: Business
---

Most individuals taking this course are moving into a STEM field - not business; however, it is always nice to know what the news channels imply when they mention things like revenue, cost, profit, marginal cost, and so on.
- **Revenue** is the **product** of the price of the item and the number of items sold.
	- Mathematically, $R(n)=p(n)\cdot n$
		- $p(n)$ is the price-demand function (the price the company charges when the market demands $n$ items)
		- $n$ is the number of items sold
- **Profit** is the difference between the revenue from sales and the cost of producing an item.
	- Mathematically, $P(n)=R(n)-C(n)$, where
		- $R(n)$ is the revenue function
		- $C(n)$ is the cost function
- **Marginal Cost** is the change in the total cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented. It is the change in cost with respect to the number of items produced (sound familiar - key word here: **_change_**)
	- Mathematically, $M_C(n)=\dfrac{dC}{dn}$ where 
		- $C(n)$ is the cost function (the cost of producing $n$ items)
- **Marginal Revenue** is the change in the total revenue that arises when the quantity produced is incremented. The change in revenue with respect to the number of items produced.
	- Mathematically, $M_R(n)=\dfrac{dR}{dn}$ where
		- $R(n)$ is the revenue function

When we hear "marginal \[insert business phrasing here\]," it means that you need to take the derivative of that "business phrasing." The result will represent the cost, profit, revenue, etc. associated with one additional item being produced
