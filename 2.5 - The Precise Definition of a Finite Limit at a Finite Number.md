## Foreword: A Lesson in Patience

Read this section slowly and thoroughly, it's **_important_**.

## Quantifying Closeness
---

Quick reminder that will help with the upcoming definitions and proofs:
- Distance between two points = $|a - b|$
	- Keep in mind the basic 1-dimensional number line: <-----|------|---->
	- With the first line being $a$ and the second line being $b$ (or vice versa, it doesn't matter since we're measuring _distance_ (which is the absolute value) between two points)

Expanding on the definition above, we now apply it to _functions and limits_:
- The statement $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ may be interpreted as: **The distance between $f(x)$ and $L$ is less than $\epsilon$**
	- $\epsilon$ = epsilon
	- $L$ = the limit of $f(x)$
	- Breaking this down further, we know that $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$, since we're talking about $x\to\infty$ any **_other_** $x$ will be less than $\infty$. So this statement shows that for any output of the function $f(x)$, there is a 'space' between that output and $L$ (which is what the function tends to when $x\to\infty$). 
		- Side note on the "less than" above, the language doesn't hold true for those cases where $x\to -\infty$ because $-\infty$ will always be "less than" any other output (when looking on a number line), so be aware that the "less than" language isn't _universal_, it should be "some output _other than_ $f(x)$ when $x\to\infty$ or $x\to -\infty$" (using so many words to describe this is tiring, but necessary at the beginning).
	- Taking the same number line above: <------------|----------------------------------------|---------->
		- With the first line being some output of $f(x)$ where $x\not=\infty$ and the second line being $f(x)$ where $x\to\infty$ (because $x$ can't _equal_ infinity based on the definition of infinity)
		- The space between $f(x) = \textrm{not the limit}$ and $f(x)=L$ is called **_epsilon ($\epsilon$)_**
	- Based on the definition above, the space between some output of $f(x)$ and the limit of $f(x)$ will always be **less than** $\epsilon$
	- Looking at it from a different perspective, $\epsilon$ is measuring the distance (absolute value) between "y-values" or outputs of $f(x)$, one output being the limit, the other output being something other than the limit.
- The statement $0<|x-a|<\delta$ may be interpreted as: **The distance between $x$ and $a$ is less than $\delta$**.
	- $x$ = our (input) variable that moves
	- $a$ = our (input) 'anchor' point that doesn't move
	- $\delta$ = delta, some value that is greater than the distance between $x$ and $a$
	- Breaking this down further - we're still working with a one-dimensional number line and the space between two points on that number line. Since we're dealing with _distance_, the absolute value of the distance between $x$ and $a$ will always be positive (i.e., **greater than zero**, the left end of the inequality). The right-hand side of the inequality is there to more clearly define how "large" that distance is between $x$ and $a$. 
		- This setup is the same kind of thing that we see in the Squeeze Theorem, bounding a function to prove that the value (output) of that function tends toward a particular answer.

In calculus, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ are going to be very small positive numbers, in most cases, they will be infinitesimally small (i.e., both $\to0^+$).

Some equivalent statements to the ones above:
- $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$ is equivalent to $L-\epsilon<f(x)<L+\epsilon$
	- The absolute value of the distance between a function's output and the limit of that function is less than epsilon. This also means that the output of the function is **_between_** epsilon **minus** the limit and epsilon **plus** the limit. Remember that epsilon is a value larger than the distance between the output and the limit. All we're doing here is 'distributing' the limit across the inequality to get the output of the function by itself.
- $0<|x-a|<\delta$ is equivalent to the statement $a-\delta<x<a+\delta$, where $x\not=a$
	- Same as above

>[!Definition] Definition: $\delta$-Neighborhood Centered at $a$
>
>A $\delta$-neighborhood centerd at $a$ is defined to be the interval $(a-\delta,a)\cup(a,a+\delta)$ on the x-axis

>[!Definition] Definition: $\epsilon$-Neighborhood Centered at $L$
>
>An $\epsilon$-neighborhood centered at $L$ is defined to be the interval $(L-\epsilon, L+\epsilon)$ on the y-axis

There is a major difference between the two definitions. A $\delta$-neighborhood _never_ includes its center $(x=a)$, while an $\epsilon$-neighborhood _always_ includes its center $(y=L)$. A $\delta$-neighborhood is also known as a **punctured neighborhood**.

Now look at how "closeness" is related to the idea of a limit

>[!Success] Example
>
>Using the concepts of "closeness" presented here (specifically, $\delta-$ and $\epsilon$-neighborhoods), create a possible interpretation of: $$\lim_{x\to 1}(5x+1)=6$$
>
>**Solution**
>
>**Building the logic:** Since $f(x)=5x+1$ is approaching 6 as $x$ is approaching 1, it seems like we are considering a group of x-values near 1 whose corresponding values on the function $f(x)$ are approaching 6.
>- Keep in mind, we're talking about **inputs and outputs to a function**. Don't get confused with how things are labeled, ultimately we're talking about how the distance between inputs is related to the distance between outputs. Just like how a function's inputs are related to a function's outputs.
>  
>**Tying this to intervals:** In terms of intervals, it _appears to be the case_ that we are saying all the x-values in an interval (neighborhood) around $x=1$ lead to y-values in an interval (neighborhood) around $y=6$
>- Reinforcing the idea of the **relation between inputs and outputs**. As the inputs get closer (from either side, the "neighborhood") to a specific number (our "x"), the outputs (from either side, the "neighborhood") get closer to a specific number (our "y" OR our "$L$").
>
>**Tightening up the language:** Perhaps this means that all the x-values in a $\delta$-neighborhood centered at $x=1$ lead to function values in an $\epsilon$-neighborhood centered at $y=6$

Since we haven't developed an actual definition of the limit yet, we're _guessing_ our way there. That's why the language is imprecise.

## The $\epsilon$ Gauntlet
---

When handed the limit: $\lim\limits_{x\to1}(5x+1)=6$, we are being told that no matter what sized $\epsilon$-neighborhood someone creates about $y=6$, we should be able to find a small enough $\delta$-neighborhood about $x=1$ so the function $f(x)=5x+1$ is very close to the supposed limit 6 whenever $x$ is close to 1. What is meant by "close?" As long as our value of $x$ is within the delta-neighborhood, then the corresponding value of $f(x)$ should be within the given epsilon-neighborhood.

We should be thinking about this in terms of _outputs first_. This means that we have to think of the epsilon-neighborhood (the area around the output or "y" value or _limit_) first. If we have a particular y-value within a given epsilon-neighborhood, that means the "x" value (the input) is **_also within a given delta-neighborhood because it is the input to the function_**. 
- Remember how a function works? We plug in an input, and we get an output by carrying out the operations contained within the function. What if we don't know what operations the function does in detail? In other words, instead of getting something nice like $f(x)=x^2+1$, we get $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=5$, $f(3)=10$...
- One perspective to take on the paragraph above is to say "if I have a function where $f(1)=2$, and I get an answer of 2.1 when I don't know the precise input, I _should_ have an input of $f(1 \pm x)$" where $x$ is in the delta-neighborhood of 1 (our original input to the function).

The act of being handed a static epsilon and challenged to find a corresponding delta is called the **epsilon gauntlet**. We are being challenged to find an appropriate **delta-neighborhood for the epsilon provided**. 

>[!Success] Example: Finding $\delta$ Given $\epsilon$
>
>Consider the limit: $$\lim_{x\to1}(5x+1)=6$$
>
>Find an appropriate $\delta$ so that all the function values, $f(x)=5x+1$ lie within $\epsilon=0.001$ units of $y=6$ whenever $x$ is within $\delta$ units of $x=1$.
>
>**Solution**
>
>The $\epsilon$ gauntlet has been thrown. The challenge is to find a $\delta$-neighborhood about $x=1$ such that all of the corresponding function values land in the $\epsilon$-neighborhood about $y=6$. The **size of the neighborhood** is 0.001.
>
>The given epsilon-neighborhood rises from: $$y=6-\epsilon=6-0.0001=5.999$$ to $$y=6+\epsilon=6+0.0001=6.0001$$
>
>Solving $5.999 = 5x+1$ and $6.001=5x+1$, we get $x=0.9998$ and $x=1.0002$, respectively. This means that as long as $x\in(0.9998,1)\cup(1,1.0002) f(x)\in(5.999,6.001)$
>- Take a close look at this. Starting from the **outputs** - specifically a **range of outputs around our anchor "y"**, we're proving that the **neighborhood or range of inputs** is limited to the $\delta$-neighborhood.
>
>To compute the value of $\delta$, we look at the length of each subinterval on the x-axis (remember we have to do subintervals because $x\not=a$). The first is $(0.9998, 1)$. This has a length (distance) of 0.0002. Likewise, the subinterval $(1, 1.0002)$ has a length of 0.0002. Thus we choose $\delta = 0.0002$.
>
>Now we establish the relationship between neighborhoods: whenever $x$ is within $\delta=0.0002$ units of 1 on the x-axis, the corresponding function value, $f(x)$, must therefore be within $\epsilon=0.001$ units of $y=6$.

>Additional Note: The concept of "right minus left" will become super important when we discuss integrals and their applications.

## The Precise Definition of a Finite Limit at a Finite Number
---

With the clarifications above, we can state the formal $\epsilon - \delta$ definition of a finite limit at a finite number.

>[!Definition] Definition: Finite Limit at a Finite Number (Precise Definition)
>
>Let $f(x)$ be defined for all $x\not=a$ over an open interval containing $a$, and let $L$ be a real number. We say $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$, such that if $0<|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.
>
>Stated with symbolic logic, $$lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$ means $$\forall\epsilon>0, \exists\delta>0 \ni$$ $$0<|x-a|<\delta\implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$
>
>Stated in plain language (because that's a lot above):
>- The limit as $x$ approaches $a$ for some function $f(x)$ will produce the output (limit) $L$.
>- The inputs and outputs of a function are related in such a way that if we change the value of an input, a corresponding change happens in the output **and vice versa**. If we look at a different output in the **epsilon-neighborhood** for the same function, there **_must_** be a corresponding input in the **delta-neighborhood** for the function.

## Critically Analyzing the Structure of the Precise Definition of a Finite Limit at a Finite Number
---

Let's break the definition down. There's a **universal quantifier** (for every $\epsilon>0$ or $\forall\epsilon>0$), an **existential quantifier** (there exists a $\delta>0$, or $\exists\delta>0$), and a **conditional statement** (if $0<|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$). Table time!

|Definition|Symbolic Logic|Translation|
|:-|:-:|:-|
|For every $\epsilon>0$|$\forall\epsilon>0$|For every positive distance $\epsilon$ from $L$|
|there exists a $\delta>0$|$\exists\delta>0$|there is a positive distance $\delta$ from $a$|
|such that|$\ni$|such that|
|if $0<\vert x-a \vert<\delta$, then $\vert f(x)-L\vert <\epsilon$ | $0<\vert x-a\vert <\delta\implies\vert f(x)-L\vert <\epsilon$| if $x$ is within $\delta$ units of $a$ and $x\not=a$, then $f(x)$ is _within $\epsilon$_ units of $L$|

## Graphically Interpreting the Precise Definition of a Finite Limit at a Finite Number
---

We can get a better handle on this definition by looking at the definition geometrically. The screenshot below shows possible values of $\delta$ for various choices of $\epsilon>0$ for a given function $f(x)$, a number $a$, and a limit $L$ at $a$. As we choose smaller and smaller values of $\epsilon$ (the distance between the function's output of a chosen input and the limit), we can always find a $\delta$ small enough so that if we have chosen an $x$ value witin $\delta$ of $a$, then the value of $f(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ of the limit $L$.

## The Importance of Scratch Work
---

It is **incredibly** important to understand that mathematicians do not magically write clean proofs from step 1 to step x without doing a lot of scratch work. **Scratch work** is where the _real_ magic happens. It is where you allow yourself to think creatively, experiment with options, and discover pathways to the proof without fear of judgment and comments from someone looking over your shoulder. The proof is a cleaned-up version of the scratch work with logically deductive steps and no flaws.

Theorems come in many forms, the form that is relevant to us right now is the "if..., then..." statement. An "if..., then..." statement is a theorem (or conjecture) that is either written as:
- "If P is true, then Q is true" where P and Q are simple statements, or
- is written in a form that can be **rewritten** as the form above

The "if" part of a theorem is known as the **antecedent** (Latin root - "going before") and the "then" part is called the **consequent** (Latin root - "to follow closely" outcome, consequence). 

Scratch work is building the **antecedent** to match the **consequent** that is known (just like the proof above, we made a clear statement about the output and logically found our way to how it impacts the input). Scratch work often starts by assuming we have arrived at the consequent. We then work backwards to see how we got to the consequent. We hope this will eventually, with some possible conditions, allow us to work all the way back to the antecedent.

>
>**REMEMBER:** the structure of a proof should be closely aligned with the structure of the precise definition of a limit (because we know the precise definition of a limit to be true). It should flow in the following direction:

>$$0<|x-a|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$
>In this specific case, we substitute our $x\to1$ for $|x-a|$ and $(5x-1)=6$ for $f(x)-L$:

>$$0<|x-1|<\delta \implies |(5x+1)-6|<\epsilon$$
>
>**PROOF**
>
>$\forall\epsilon>0$, choose $\delta=\dfrac{\epsilon}{5}$. Therefore, if $0<|x-1|<\delta$, then:

>$$\implies5|x-1|<\epsilon$$
>$$\implies|5x-5|<\epsilon$$
>$$\implies |(5x+1)-6|<\epsilon$$
>$$\implies|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$$
>
> Thus we have proved the limit $$\lim_{x\to 1}(5x+1)=6$$

Some things to pay attention to:
1. We always need to do scratch work when attempting a proof. Not doing so is akin to not looking at the cover of a puzzle box when attempting to piece a puzzle together.
2. The scratch work starts with the **consequent** and works backwards to (hopefully) arrive at the antecedent.
3. We have no control over what $\epsilon$ they hand us, but $\delta$ will almost always be a function of $\epsilon$ (the single exception is when proving the limit of a constant function).
4. The structure of our proof will be closely aligned with the language of the precise definition of a limit with the exception that we will not be saying, "there exists a $\delta$ >0," but rather "let $\delta =...$" because we actually found a workable $\delta$ in our scratch work

>[!Warning] Quick Note About Antecedent Notation
>
>Some of the examples used will look like they are a variant of the proof that was provided. Here's the proof: $$0<|x-a|<\delta$$
>Here's an example from above: $$|x-1|<\dfrac{\epsilon}{5}$$
>
>We may be wondering where the $0<...$ went. We dropped it because that end of the inequality will go to zero no matter what we do on that end of the inequality. That end of the inequality is still there, it's just not stated.

## Proving Finite Limits at Finite Numbers (non-symmetric $\delta$-neighborhoods)
---

What happens if the $\delta$-neighborhood is not symmetric about $x=a$? What does this mean?

Consider: $f(x)=x^2$ as $x\to2$. For a given $\epsilon>0$, we create an interval of sufficient x-values on the x-axis whose function values land in the interval $(4-\epsilon, 4+\epsilon)$.

![[fig-2-5-2.png]]

The size of the interval of acceptable values _to the left_ of $x=2$ looks to be slightly greater than the size of the interval of acceptable values to the right of $x=2$. If we let $\delta_L$ be the size of the interval to the left, and $\delta_R$ be the size of the interval to the right, then as long as $x\in(2-\delta_L,2)\cup(2,2+\delta_R)$ (the x-range on the graph, or the $\delta$-neighborhood) we know $f(x)=x^2\in(4-\epsilon, 4+\epsilon)$ (the y-range on the graph, or the $\epsilon$-neighborhood).

_However_, $\delta$- and $\epsilon$-neighborhoods are defined to be **symmetric** about their centers (either side of an 'anchor point'). We have an issue because it looks as though our $\delta$-neighborhood is not symmetric about $x=2$. What do we do?

If given two choices for $\delta$, always take the smaller. For example, if we performed the computations given $\epsilon=2$ (a large $\epsilon$-neighborhood), we would find $\delta_L \approx 0.586$ and $\delta_R\approx 0.449$. This means that for $x\in(1.414,2)\cup(2, 2.449) f(x)\in(2,6)$.

If all of the x-values in the interval $(1.414,2)\cup(2,2.449)$ have this property, then all of the x-values in a smaller subinterval of $(1.414,2)\cup(2,2.449)$ must also share this same property. Therefore, if we "tighten-up" the interval to be symmetric about $x=2$ using the minimum of $\delta_L$ and $\delta_R$, the resulting set of x-values should still map to function values within the given $\epsilon$-neighborhood about $y=4$. $$\delta_L\approx 2-1.414 = 0.586 \textrm{ and } \delta_R\approx 2.449-2 = 0.449$$
Hence, we choose $\delta$ to be: $$\min\{\delta_L,\delta_R\}\approx\min\{0.586,0.449\}=0.449$$
Shorthand: If we have an asymmetrical interval, we always go with the minimum of the two interval values. This is because the larger of the intervals contains a value equivalent to the smaller interval and therefore has the same properties as the smaller interval. 

An algebraic approach is the primary tool used in proofs of statements about limits.

>[!Tip] Building the Bound
>
>In some cases, we'll need to build a proof where we get a factored $f(x)$ that will end up with a non-perfect square polynomial, for example: $x^2-2x-3$. In these cases, we'll have to factor the polynomial and build a bound.

What we're doing with the first step is saying that the $x$ we start with is approaching $-1$, ok. **Then** we assume that same $x$ is within 1 unit of $-1$, and come up with our initial inequality $-2<x<0$. **Then** we subtract 3 from all parts of the inequality (this is where I got confused) - we're subtracting 3 because one of our factors is $(x-3)$, so we're building an inequality to **bound** the max and min values of that factor to turn it into a constant. This turns our inequality from $$-2<x<0$$ to $$-5<x-3<-3$$.

>
> > [!Warning] Timeout

In general, the more complex a function, the more likely it is that the algebraic approach is the easiest to apply. the algebraic approach is also more useful in proving statements about limits.

## Proving Limit Laws
---

We now demonstrate how to use the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition of a limit to construct a rigorous proof of one of the Limit Laws. The **Triange Inequality** is used at a key point of the proof, so we first review this key property of absolute value.

>
>**Proof**
>
>Let $\epsilon > 0$. Choose $\delta_1 >0$ so that if $0<|x-a|<\delta_1$, then $|f(x)-L|<\dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$, and choose $\delta_2>0$ so that if $0<|x-a|<\delta_2$, then $|g(x)-M|<\dfrac{\epsilon}{2}$. Let $\delta=\min\{\delta_1,\delta_2\}$. If $0<|x-a|<\delta$, then $$0<|x-a|<\delta_1 \textrm{ and } 0<|x-a|<\delta_2$$
>
>Hence: $$|(f(x)+g(x))-(L+M)|=|(f(x)-L)+(g(x)-M)|$$
