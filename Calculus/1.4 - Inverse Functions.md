An inverse function **reverses** the operation done by a particular function. Whatever a function does, the inverse function undoes it. 

## Existence of an Inverse Function

>[!Definition: Inverse Functions]
>
>Given a function $f$ with domain $D$ and range $R$, its **inverse function** (if it exists) is the function $f^{-1}$ with domain $R$ and range $D$ such that $f^{-1}(y)=x$ if and only if $f(x)=y$. In other words, for a function $f$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$:
>- $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$
>	- for all $x$ in $D$ and
>- $f(f^{-1}(y))=y$
>	- for all $y$ in $R$

A function has exactly one output for each input. To define an inverse function, we need to map each input to **exactly one** output. 

>[!Definition: One-to-One Functions]
>
>A **one-to-one function** is a function that has only one output for every input
>- $f(x_1) \not= f(x_2)$ when $x_1 \not= x_2$

One way to test if a function is a one-to-one function is by using the **horizontal line test**.

>[!Theorem: Horizontal Line Test]
>A function $f$ is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph of $f$ no more than once

## Finding the Inverse of a Function

A function maps elements in the domain (inputs) of $f$ to elements in the range (outputs) of $f$. The inverse function maps each element from the range (outputs) of $f$ back to its corresponding element from the domain (inputs) of $f$. Since $f$ is one-to-one (in this case), we need to determine which $x$ in the domain (inputs) of $f$ satisfies $f(x)=y$. We can find that value $x$ by solving the equation $f(x)=y$ **_for x_**. This will give us the ability to write $x$ as a function of $y$ where the domain of the function is the range of $f$ and the range of the new function is the domain of $f$.

- Example:
	- $f(x)=3x-4$, find $f^{-1}(f(x))$ and verify that $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$
		- $y=3x-4$
		- $x=3y-4$
		- $x+4=3y$
		- $\dfrac{x+4}{3} = y$
		- $f^{-1}(x)=\dfrac{x+4}{3}$
		- $f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(3x-4) = \frac{1}{3}(3x-4)+\frac{4}{3} = x - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{4}{3} = x$

## Graphing Inverse Functions

Easiest way that I've found - rotate and flip
- Rotate the graph $90 \degree$ counter-clockwise
- Flip the graph over the y-axis

Directions generally given by math texts:
- Draw a line $y=x$
- Reflect the graph across this line

I find the second strategy harder to implement personally, so I generally use the first strategy.

## Restricting Domains

When dealing with inverse functions, since functions **require** a one-to-one relationship for an inverse function to exist, we can restrict the domain (inputs) of the original function so that it can have an inverse in a given domain.

This domain subset is called a **restricted domain**. By restricting $f$, we define a new function $g$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ within the restricted domain, but $g(x)$ is also one-to-one so $g^{-1}(x)$ also exists.
