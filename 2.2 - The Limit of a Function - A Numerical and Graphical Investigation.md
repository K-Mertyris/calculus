The formal definiton of a limit (as we know it today) did not appear until the late 19th century. We will follow the same journey, understanding limits intuitively, then by the formal definition. Limits help to express the behavior of graphs (and functions) as they approach some number.

## Finite Limit at a Finite Number
---

Using the function $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}$, we want to see how it behaves around $x=2$. As the values of $x$ approach 2 from either side of 2, the values of $y=f(x)$ approach 4. We say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 2 is 4: $$\lim_{x\to2}f(x)=4$$
From here, we start to develop an intuitive definition of the finite limit at a finite number. We can think of the limit of a function at a **finite number** $a$ as being the real finite number $L$ (the _finite limit_) that the functional values approach as the x-values approach $a$, provided $L$ exists.

>
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a finite number $a$, with $a$ being a possible exception to the interval, and let $L$ be a finite real number. If all values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number $L$ as the values of $x$ approach $a$ (but never equal $a$), then we say that the **finite limit** of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches the **finite number** $a$ is $L$. We express this idea as: $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$

This section explores how to _estimate_ the value of a limit using tables and graphs.

## Using Tables to Estimate Limits
---

When estimating limits using tables and graphs there's a general strategy that we can follow.

>[!Example] Problem-Solving Strategy: Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values
>
>1. To evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$, we create and complete a table of values. We're going to approach $a$ from the left and the right.
>	1. Easiest way to think of this is as a 1-dimensional number line with $a$ in the middle. We pick an $x$ value to the left of $a$ ($\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}$), and to the right of $a$ ($\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}$). Pick consecutively closer and closer numbers to $a$ and enter the values of $f(x)$ into the table.
>2. Analyze the values in each of the output ($f(x)$) columns and see if they're approaching a specific number.
>3. If both output columns ($f(x)$ as $x^-\to a$ and as $x^+ \to a$) approach a common output ($L$), we state $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L$.
>	1. In other words - as $x$ approaches $a$ (**our anchor point**) from the left and the right, if the $x$ values from both ends trend towards a specific number (which we'll call $L$ for "Limit"), we _can_ state that as $x$ approaches $a$, the **function** $f(x)$ equals some number $L$.
>	2. Note that for this to work, $f(x)$ must trend towards the same $L$ as $x$ approaches from both sides.
>4. We can plot the function $f(x)$ in a calculator or graphing app and trace the graph to move along the outputs of the function to see what happens as $x\to a$.

## Using Graphs to Estimate Limits
---

Sometimes it may be easier to estimate a limit of a function by analyzing the graph of the function. The basic strategy is:

1. Graph the function
2. Trace the function from the left
3. Trace the function from the right
4. Does the graph trend towards a specific point? That's the $L$ (limit) of the function.
	1. **_Even if the actual point is $\pm$ some number off the graph_**
	2. This is because we're looking for how the graph **_trends_** - if the graph were uninterrupted, what value **_would_** be present at our **anchor point** $a$?

>[!Warning] Tricky tricky
>
>It is possible for the limit of a function to exist at a point, and for the function to be defined at this point, but the limit of the funciton and the **value** of the function at the point may be different.

## Two Important Limits
---

Looking at tables or at graphs gives some insight into how the function generally behaves and the value of the limit ($L$) of a function at a given point. Both techniques involve guessing though and we want to be precise, so we have to use different methods to evaluate limits (so we can be exact).

The following two special limits are foundational for upcoming work.

>[!Example] Two Important Limits
>
>Let $a$ be a real number and $c$ be a constant
>
>1. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}x = a$
>2. $\lim\limits_{x\to a}c = c$
>
>We can make the following observations about these two limits:
>
>1. For the first limit, observe that as $x$ approaches $a$, so does $f(x)$ because $f(x)=x$. Consequently, $\lim\limits_{x\to a} = a$.
>	1. This may be hard to parse - the implied function for the first limit is $f(x)=x$ (or $x=x$), so when we add the limit symbols $\lim\limits_{x\to a} x = a$, the function $x=x$ changes to $x=a$ because as $x/to a$, $f(x)=a$.
>2. For the second limit, no matter what happens with $x$, the function states that the **constant** $c$ is always going to be the answer to the function $f(c)$.

## The Existence of a Limit
---

For the next example, remember that for the limit of a function to exist at a **point**, the functional values must approach a single real-number value at that point ($f(x^-) = f(x^+) = L$ as $x\to a^-, x\to a^+$). If the functional values do not approach a single value, then the limit does not exist (DNE).

- Evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ using a table of values
	- Plugging values into the table we'll see that $f(x^-) \not= f(x^+)$ as $x^-\to a, x^+\to a$. The limit for the function $f(x)=\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ does not exist (DNE).
	- Expressed in math symbols: $\lim\limits_{x\to0}\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ DNE.

## One-Sided Limits
---

Sometimes saying that the limit of a function DNE doesn't give us enough info about what the function is doing at that particular point (is it an empty circle, is it an asymptote, etc.). To get a bit more accuracy, we'll introduce the idea of a **one-sided limit**.

- Take the function $g(x)=\dfrac{|x-2|}{(x-2)}$:
	- For all values to the **left** of 2 (the 'negative' side of 2), $g(x)$ approaches $-1$
		- As $x$ approaches 2 from the left, $g(x)$ approaches $-1$.
		- Expressed in math symbols: $\lim\limits_{x\to2^-}g(x)=-1$
	- For all values to the **right** of 2 (the 'positive' side of 2), $g(x)$ approaches $1$
		- As $x$ approaches 2 from the right, $g(x)$ approaches $1$
		- Expressed in math symbols: $\lim\limits_{x\to 2^+}g(x)=1$

>[!Note] Definition: One-sided Limits
>
>We define two types of one-sided limits.
>
>**Limit from the left:**
>
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form $(z,a)$, and let $L$ be a real number. If the values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number $L$ as the values of $x$ (where $x<a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that $L$ is the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left.
>$$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=L$$
>
>**Limit from the right:**
>
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form $(a,c)$, and let $L$ be a real number. If the values of the function $f(x)$ approach the real number $L$ as the values of $x$ (where $x>a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that $L$ is the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right.
>$$\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)=L$$

If the limit from the right and the limit from the left have a common value, then that common value is the limit of that function at that point. If the limit from the left and the limit from the right are different values, the limit of the function DNE.

>[!Example] Theorem: Relating One-Sided and Two-Sided Limits
>
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing $a$, with the possible exception of $a$ itself, and let $L$ be a real number, $\infty$, or $-\infty$. Then $$\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$ if and only if (IIF) $$\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)=L$$ AND $$\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x)=L$$

## Infinite Limit at a Finite Number
---

Evaluating the limit of a function at a point or evaluating the limit of a function from the right and left at a point assists in seeing how a function behaves around a value. We can also describe the behavior of functions that do not have finite limits.

>[!Note] Definitions (Intuitive): Infinite Limits at Finite Numbers
>
>We define three types of **infinite limits at finite numbers**:
>
>1. Infinite limits from the left
>2. Infinite limits from the right
>3. Two-sided infinite limit
>
>**Infinite limits from the left**:
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form $(b,a)$.
>1. If the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound as the values of $x$ (where $x<a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is positive infinity and we write: $$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=+\infty$$
>2. If the values of $f(x)$ decrease without bound as the values of $x$ (where $x<a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is negative infinity and we write: $$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=-\infty$$
>
>**Infinite limits from the right**:
>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form $(a,c)$.
>1. If the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound as the values of $x$ (where $x>a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right is positive infinity and we write: $$\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=+\infty$$
>2. If the values of $f(x)$ decrease without bound as the values of $x$ (where $x>a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right is negative infinity and we write: $$\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=-\infty$$
>
>**Two-sided infinite limit**:
>Let $f(x)$ be defined for all $x\not= a$ in an open interval containing $a$
>1. If the values of $f(x)$ increase without bound as the values of $x$ (where $x\not=a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ is negative infinity and we write: $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=+\infty$$
>2. If the values of $f(x)$ decrease without bound as the values of $x$ (where $x\not=a$) approach the number $a$, then we say that the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ is negative infinity and we write: $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=-\infty$$

When we write statements like $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=+\infty, \lim\limits{x\to a}f(x)=-\infty$, we are describing the **behavior** of the function, **as defined**. 

>[!Note] Definition: Vertical Asymptote
>
>The function $f(x)$ is said to have a **vertical asymptote** at $x=a$ if any of the following are true:
>$$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=+\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=-\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=+\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=-\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=+\infty$$
>$$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=-\infty$$

## Conceptual Investigation of an Infinite Limit
---

The conceptual investigation of a limit is done by using **mathematical concepts to model behavior of a function as it approaches a vertical asymptote**. When given a function that has a vertical asymptote at $x=a$, a conceptual investigation of the limit as $x\to a$ can often be done.

>[!Tip] Functions like $\dfrac{c}{x}$
>
>If the numerator is approaching a **nonzero constant** and the denominator is approaching zero, the ratio $\dfrac{N(x)}{D(x)}$ approaches either $+\infty$ or $-\infty$. You determine the sign of the infinity by comparing the signs of the numerator and denominator of the ratio of functions as $x$ is approaching $a$.
>
>Remember:
>$$\dfrac{+}{+}=+$$
>$$\dfrac{+}{-}=-, \dfrac{-}{+}=-$$
>$$\dfrac{-}{-}=+$$

General Strategy:
1. Analyze the numerator to determine what it does as $x\to a$, and what sign it has
2. Analyze the denominator to determine what it does as $x\to a$, and what sign it has
3. Plug those values back in to the fraction
4. Determine what sign the $\infty$ has based on the information provided in previous steps

- Examples:
	- $\lim\limits_{x\to7^+}\dfrac{2}{x-7}$
		- Numarator: as $x\to 7^+$, $x=2$, numerator is positive
		- Denominator: as $x\to 7^+$, $(x-7)\to0$, denominator is **positive** since $x$ is approaching 7 from a number **greater than 7**. 
		- Recombining: $\dfrac{+2}{+0}$
			- Note that I'm putting the 'signs' of the values in the expression purely for the purposes of showing all the steps. Future examples may omit positive signs.
		- $\lim\limits_{x\to7^+}\dfrac{2}{x-7}=\infty$
	- $\lim\limits_{x\to7^-}\dfrac{2}{x-7}$
		- Numerator: as $x\to7^-$, $x=2$, numerator is positive
		- Denominator: as $x\to7^-$, $(x-7)\to0$, denominator is **negative** since $x$ is approaching 7 from a number **less than 7**.
		- Recombining: $\dfrac{+2}{-0}$
		- $\lim\limits_{x\to7^-}\dfrac{2}{x-7}=-\infty$
	- $\lim\limits_{x\to (\pi/2)^-}\ln(\cot(x))$
		- $\cot(x)=\dfrac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}$
		- $\cot(\pi/2)=\dfrac{\cos(\pi/2)}{\sin(\pi/2)}$
		- $\cot(\pi/2)=\dfrac{0}{1}$
		- $\ln(\cot{\pi/2}) = \ln(0)$
		- $\ln(x)$ as $x\to0$ is negative
			- $e^2$
