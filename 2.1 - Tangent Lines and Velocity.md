Two key problems led to the initial formulation of calculus: 1) the tangent problem, or how to determine the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a point; 2) the area problem, or how to determine the area under a curve.

## Rates of Change
---

**Rate of change** is one of the most critical concepts in calculus. Rate of change is determined by the slope of the line; **only linear functions have slope**.

>[!Example] Theorem: Lines have constant rates of change
>
>The rate of change at any given point $(a, f(a))$ of a linear function is constant and equal to the [[1.3 - Basic Classes of Functions and Their Graphs|slope of the function]].

How do we measure the rate of change of a nonlinear function? Is it possible to determine the rate of change at specific points since the rate of change varies across the entire graph?

Yes. To measure the rate of change of a nonlinear function at a point $(a, f(a))$, we measure the slope of the **tangent line** at the point.

>[!Note] Definition: Tangent Line (Informal)
>
>The **tangent line** (or tangent) to a plane (two-dimensional, $(x,y)$) curve at a given point is the straight line that "just touches" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve.
>
>As it passes through the point where the tanget line and the curve meet (the **point of tangency**), the tangent line is "going in the same direction" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line **approximation** to the curve at that point.
>
>The slope of the tangent line is also referred to as the **instantaneous rate of change** of $f(x)$ at $(a, f(a))$

## Tangent and Secant Lines
---

It is possible to approximate the instantaneous rate of change of a function $f(x)$ at a point $(a, f(a))$ on its graph by taking another point $(x, f(x))$ on the graph of $f(x)$, drawing a line through the two points (creating a linear function with slope $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$), and calculating the slope of the resulting line. This line is called a **secant line**.

>[!Note] Definition: Secant Line (Formal)
>
>The **secant line** (secant) to the function $f(x)$ through the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(x,f(x))$ is the line passing through these points. Its slope is given by:
>
>$$m_{sec}=\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$

The accuracy of the secant line in measuring the instantaneous rate of change will depend on how close $x$ is to $a$. The closer $x$ is, the more accurate it will be in measuring the instantaneous rate of change at point $(a,f(a))$. Cases where this is not true will be covered later.

>[!Tip] Note: Anchor Points
>
>The point $(a,f(a))$ is commonly referred to as the **anchor point** because it is "anchored" to a single spot while the secondary point, $(x,f(x))$, is moved toward it.

## Approximating the Slope of the Tangent Line
---

For the following, we need to use the the formula for the slope of the secant line $\bigg(m_{sec}=\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\bigg)$.
Estimate the slope of the tangent line to the function $g(x)=-2\sin(\pi x) + 2$ at $x=\frac{1}{4}$ to three decimal places.

### Method 1: Explicitly Choosing Values Near _a_
---

Successively pick numbers closer and closer to $a$ (in this case 0.25) from both the right and left of $a$ to get an approximation to the slope of the tangent line.

- $g(x)=-2\sin(\pi x)+2$ at $x=\frac{1}{4}$
- $m_{sec}=\dfrac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}$
- $=\dfrac{-2\sin(\pi x)+2-g(\frac{1}{4})}{x-\frac{1}{4}}$
- $=\dfrac{-2\sin(\pi x)+2-(2-\sqrt{2})}{x-\frac{1}{4}}$
- $=\dfrac{-8\sin(\pi x)+4\sqrt{2}}{4x-1}$

Taking the above expanded equation of the secant line, we plug in numbers from both the left and the right of $a$ and find that as $x\to a$, $m_{sec}\to -4.443$. 

>[!Warning] Caution: Calculus Requires Radians
>
>Whenever using a calculator with trigonometric functions and calculus problems, we **must** set the calculator to **radians**.
>

### Method 2: Choosing "Wiggles"
---

This is the preferred approach for the rest of calculus. Pick smaller and smaller numbers to decrease the "wiggled distance" between $a$ and $x$.

Instead of working with just $x$, we substitute $a+h$ for $x$ so that $x=a+h$ and allow $h$ to get smaller and smaller. As $h$ gets closer to zero (leaving us with just $a$), $a+h$ gets closer to $a$.

- $m_{sec}=\dfrac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}$
- $=\dfrac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{(a+h)-a}$
- $=\dfrac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}$
- $=\dfrac{g(0.25+h)-g(0.25)}{h}$
- $=\dfrac{-2\sin(\pi(0.25+h))+2-(2-\sqrt{2})}{h}$
- $=\dfrac{-2\sin(\pi(0.25+h))+\sqrt{2}}{h}$

Both methods produce the same result, but the inputs were easier to work with and made sense (since we were able to isolate the inputs instead of having them be part of a complex expression).

## Instantaneous Velocity
---

**Velocity** can be thought of as the rate of change of position. Take a function $s(t)$ that gives the position of an object along a coordinate axis at any given time $t$. Can we find a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given time $t=a$? We have to start with **average velocity** - the change in an object's position divided by the length of the time period.

>[!Note] Definition: Average Velocity
>
>Let $s(t)$ be the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis at time $t$. The **average velocity** of the object over a time interval $[a,t]$ where $a<t$ (or $[t,a]$ if $t<a$) is:
>
>$$v_{avg}=\dfrac{s(t)-s(a)}{t-a}$$

This is essentially the same formula for finding the slope of the secant line to a function. To find the slope of a tangent line at piont $a$, we have the x-values approach $a$ in the slope of the secant line. To find the **instantaneous velocity** at time $a$, we let the t-values approach $a$ in the average velocity. Letting a variable approach an anchor point is called taking a **limit**. We can define **instantaneous velocity** as follows.

>[!Note] Definition: Instantaneous Velocity
>
>For a position function $s(t)$, the **instantaneous velocity** at time $t=a$ is the value that the average velocities approach on intervals of the form $[a,t]$ and $[t,a]$ as the values of $t$ become closer to $a$, provided such a value exists.

## Technology in Calculus
---

Most of the work done in this course should be handled **without** the use of technology.

### When to Use Technology
---

Exercises or homework problems typically require assistance from tech if any of the following are true:

- We are asked to round the answer to a certain number of decimal places or significant figures
- The problem specifically states that a calculator or graphing technology must be used
- We are asked to "build a table of values" or "obtain a numerical approximation"

### How to Efficiently Use Technology to Build Tables
---

In [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) click on the plus sign in the upper left hand corner (above the textbox used to plug in equations), select "table." Fill in the $y_1$ area with the equation that we need to create a table for, and plug in the values of $x$ in the column below $x_1$.
