>- Identify the hyperbolic functions, their graphs, and basic identities

Hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions involve combinations of exponential and logarithmic functions. These functions provide a bridge between two groups of transcendental functions - exponential and trigonometric.

## From Circular to Hyperbolic Functions
---

The sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are **also known as _circular functions_** because their entire definition is based on the unit circle.

- The unit circle is defined by the relation: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
- The arc length on the unit circle subtended by an angle $\theta$ (in radians) is $s=\theta$.
	- Subtended (Latin): sub = under, tend = stretch
- The area of a sector: $A=\dfrac{1}{2}r^2\theta$
- Since the radius of the unit circle is $r=1$ and $\theta = s$, Area = $\dfrac{s}{2}$
	- Substitution: $A=\dfrac{1}{2}r^2\theta = \dfrac{1}{2}(1)^2\theta = \dfrac{1}{2}\theta = \dfrac{\theta}{2} = \dfrac{s}{2}$
	- The area of a sector of a unit circle with arc length $s$ is $\dfrac{s}{2}$
- Another way to state it:
	- The area of the region bounded by:
		- The positive x-axis
		- The unit circle
		- The line segment connecting to the origin to the point $(\cos(s), \sin(s))$
		- is $\dfrac{s}{2}$
			- $cos(s)$ is the $x$ coordinate
			- $sin(s)$ is the $y$ coordinate

The rest of this chapter deals with the question:
- Can we develop a set of functions $\cosh(s)$ and $\sinh(s)$ such that the area of the region bounded by:
	- The positive x-axis
	- The unit **hyperbola**
	- The line segment connecting the origin to the point $(\cosh(s), \sinh(s))$
	- is $\dfrac{s}{2}$?
- Spoiler: yes

How?

- We have to first define the unit hyperbola: $x^2 - y^2 = 1$
- We also have to restrict the domain to the right branch of the hyperbola
- We plot a point $(x,y)=(\cosh(s), sinh(s))$ on the branch, highlight the arc length from the x-axis to the point, draw a line segment connecting the origin to the point, and shade the bounded region.
- We want to define these new functions, $\cosh(s)$ and $\sinh(s)$ so that the area of the shaded region is $\dfrac{s}{2}$

>Our goal is to create functions that make it so the **area of the bounded region** is $\dfrac{s}{2}$, that's it.

>We are **not** finding the arc length, we are **not** finding the angle. The value $s$ used in $\cosh(s), \sinh(s)$ is to help us find the **area**.

We define the **hyperbolic cosine** to be the x-value of the terminal point and the **hyperbolic sine** as the y-value.

## Hyperbolic Functions

>In the previous section, we considered cosh and sinh as functions of $s$ (used in trig functions). Most textbooks work **exclusively** with these as functions of $t$. This also helps to differentiate between the circular trig functions and the hyperbolic trig functions.

Hyperbolic functions can be written in terms of certain combinations of $e^t$ and $e^{-t}$ (proofs are found in Calculus II). For now, the definitions for hyperbolic functions can be found below.

>[!Example] Theorem - Hyperbolic Functions Defined
>
>- Hyperbolic cosine
>$$x=\cosh(t)=\dfrac{e^t+e^{-t}}{2}$$
>- Hyperbolic sine
>$$y=\sinh(t)=\dfrac{e^t-e^{-t}}{2}$$
>- Hyperbolic tangent
>$$\tanh(t)=\dfrac{\sinh(t)}{\cosh(t)}=\dfrac{e^t-e^{-t}}{e^t+e^{-t}}$$
>- Hyperbolic secant
>$$\operatorname{sech}(t)=\dfrac{1}{\cosh(t)}=\dfrac{1}{e^t+e^{-t}}$$
>- Hyperbolic cosecant
>$$\operatorname{csch}(t)=\dfrac{1}{\sinh(t)}=\dfrac{1}{e^t-e^{-t}}$$
>- Hyperbolic cotangent
>$$\operatorname{coth}(t)=\dfrac{\cosh(t)}{\sinh(t)}=\dfrac{e^t+e^{-t}}{e^t-e^{-t}}$$

Note that we only **really** need to memorize $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ because all other hyperbolic functions are derived from those two.

## Graphs of Hyperbolic Functions
---

Taking the general information of limits, we explore what happens to $\sinh(x)$ and $\cosh(x)$ as $x\to\infty$ and $x\to -\infty$

- Base equation: $\sinh(x)=\dfrac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}$ 
	- As $x\to\infty$, $e^x\to\infty, e^{-x}\to0$ so...
		- $\sinh(x)=\dfrac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2} = \dfrac{e^x-0}{2} = \dfrac{e^x}{2}$ as $x\to\infty$
		- $\cosh(x) = \dfrac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2} = \dfrac{e^x+0}{2}=\dfrac{e^x}{2}$ as $x\to\infty$
	- As $x\to -\infty, e^x\to 0, e^{-x}\to\infty$ so...
		- $\sinh(x)=\dfrac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2} = \dfrac{0-e^{-x}}{2} = \dfrac{-e^{-x}}{2}$ as $x\to -\infty$
		- $\cosh(x) = \dfrac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2} = \dfrac{0+e^{-x}}{2} = \dfrac{e^{-x}}{2}$ as $x\to -\infty$

Using graphs of $\dfrac{1}{2}e^x$, $\dfrac{1}{2}e^{-x}$, and $-\dfrac{1}{2}e^{-x}$ as guides, we can graph $\cosh(x)$ and $\sinh(x)$.

To graph $\tanh(x)$, we use the fact that $\tanh(0)=0$ along with the fact that the numerator is smaller in magnitude than the denominator ($\sinh(t)=\dfrac{e^t-e^{-t}}{2}$ vs. $\cosh(t)=\dfrac{e^t+e^{-t}}{2}$, it's not much, but when getting into big numbers it makes a difference). Therefore, $-1<\tanh(x)<1$ for all $x$. $\tanh(x) \to 1$ as $x\to\infty$, and $\tanh(x) \to -1$ as $x\to -\infty$.

## Hyperbolic Identities
---

Since the hyperbolic functions are based on the unit hyperbola: $x^2-y^2=1$, we can find the first hyperbolic identity.

>[!Example] Theorem: The Fundamental Hyperbolic Identity
>
>$\cosh^2(t)-\sinh^2(t)=1$
>
>**Proof**
>Since $x=\cosh(t)$ and $y=\sinh(t)$ on the unit hyperbola $x^2-y^2=1$, we substitute to get $\cosh^2(t)-\sinh^2(t)=1$
>This can also be proved using the exponential form of the hyperbolic functions.

The **Fundamental Hyperbolic Identity** is one of many identities involving the hyperbolic functions, _some_ of which are listed below. The first four follow from the definitions of $\sinh$ and $\cosh$. Similar to the **circular functions**, there are some differences in signs (positive, negative).

>[!Example] Theorem: Hyperbolic Identities
>
>1. $\cosh(-t)=\cosh(t)$
>2. $\sinh(-t)=-\sinh(t)$
>3. $\cosh(t) + \sinh(t) = e^t$
>4. $\cosh(t) - \sinh(t) = e^{-t}$
>5. $1-\tanh^2(t)=\operatorname{sech}^2(t)$
>6. $\coth^2(t)-1=\operatorname{csch}^2(t)$
>7. $\sinh(t \pm v) = \sinh(t)\cosh(v) \pm \cosh(t)\sinh(v)$
>8. $\cosh(t \pm v) = \cosh(t)\cosh(v) \pm \sinh(t)\sinh(v)$

## Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
---

Based on the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, all of them are one-to-one except $\cosh(t)$ and $\operatorname{sech}(t)$. If we restrict the domains of these two functions to the interval $[0, \infty)$, all hyperbolic functions are one-to-one. This means we can define the **inverse hyperbolic functions**.

Since the hyperbolic functions involve exponential functions, the inverse hyperbolic functions involve logarithmic functions.

>[!Example] Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
>
>- $\sinh^{-1}(x)=\operatorname{arcsinh}(x)=\ln(x+\sqrt{x^2+1})$
>- $\cosh^{-1}(x)=\operatorname{arccosh}(x)=\ln(x+\sqrt{x^2-1})$
>- $\tanh^{-1}(x)=\operatorname{arctanh}(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}\ln\bigg(\dfrac{1+x}{1-x}\bigg)$
>- $\operatorname{coth}^{-1}(x)=\operatorname{arccoth}(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}\ln\bigg(\dfrac{x+1}{x-1}\bigg)$
>- $\operatorname{sech}^{-1}(x)=\operatorname{arcsech}(x)=\ln\bigg(\dfrac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}\bigg)$
>- $\operatorname{csch}^{-1}(x)=\operatorname{arccsch}(x)=\ln\bigg(\dfrac{1}{x}+\dfrac{\sqrt{1+x^2}}{|x|}\bigg)$
